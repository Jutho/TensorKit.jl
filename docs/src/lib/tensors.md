## Type hierarchy

The abstract supertype of all tensors in TensorKit is given by `AbstractTensorMap`:
```@docs
AbstractTensorMap
```

The following concrete subtypes are provided within the TensorKit library:
```@docs
TensorMap
DiagonalTensorMap
AdjointTensorMap
BraidingTensor
```

Tensor maps can be stored and restored with:
```@docs
save
load
```

Of those, `TensorMap` provides the generic instantiation of our tensor concept. It supports various constructors, which are discussed in the next subsection.

Furthermore, some aliases are provided for convenience:
```@docs
AbstractTensor
Tensor
```

## `TensorMap` constructors

### General constructors

A `TensorMap` with undefined data can be constructed by specifying its domain and codomain:
```@docs
TensorMap{T}(::UndefInitializer, V::TensorMapSpace)
```

The resulting object can then be filled with data using the `setindex!` method as discussed below, using functions such as `VectorInterface.zerovector!`, `rand!` or `fill!`, or it can be used as an output argument in one of the many methods that accept output arguments, or in an `@tensor output[...] = ...` expression.

Alternatively, a `TensorMap` can be constructed by specifying its data, codomain and domain in one of the following ways:
```@docs
TensorMap(data::AbstractDict{<:Sector,<:AbstractMatrix}, V::TensorMapSpace)
TensorMap(data::AbstractArray, V::TensorMapSpace; tol)
```

Finally, we also support the following `Array`-like constructors
```@docs
zeros(::Type, V::TensorMapSpace)
ones(::Type, V::TensorMapSpace)
rand(::Type, V::TensorMapSpace)
randn(::Type, V::TensorMapSpace)
Random.randexp(::Type, V::TensorMapSpace)
```
as well as a `similar` constructor
```@docs
Base.similar(::AbstractTensorMap, args...)
similar_diagonal(::AbstractTensorMap, args...)
```

### Specific constructors

Additionally, the following methods can be used to construct specific `TensorMap` instances.
```@docs
id
isomorphism
unitary
isometry
```

## `AbstractTensorMap` properties and data access

The following methods exist to obtain type information:

```@docs
Base.eltype(::Type{<:AbstractTensorMap{T}}) where {T}
spacetype(::Type{<:AbstractTensorMap{<:Any,S}}) where {S}
sectortype(::Type{TT}) where {TT<:AbstractTensorMap}
field(::Type{TT}) where {TT<:AbstractTensorMap}
storagetype
blocktype
```

To obtain information about the indices, you can use:
```@docs
space(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Int)
domain
codomain
numin
numout
numind
codomainind
domainind
allind
```

In `TensorMap` instances, all data is gathered in a single `AbstractVector`, which has an internal structure into blocks associated to total coupled charge, within which live subblocks associated with the different possible fusion-splitting tree pairs.

To obtain information about the structure of the data, you can use:
```@docs
dim(::AbstractTensorMap)
blocksectors(::AbstractTensorMap)
hasblock(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Sector)
fusiontrees(t::AbstractTensorMap)
```

Data can be accessed (and modified) in a number of ways.
To access the full matrix block associated with the coupled charges, you can use:
```@docs
block
blocks
```

To access the reduced tensor elements associated to fusion tree pairs, you can use:
```@docs
subblock
subblocks
```

One can access the data of an `AbstractTensorMap` in multiple ways, its availability depending on the sector type of the tensor.
In particular, the data of a tensor `t` can be accessed by specifying the fusion tree pair, the outcoming sectors if `FusionStyle(sectortype(t)) isa UniqueFusion`, or by multidimensional array indexing if `sectortype(t) == Trivial`.
```@docs
Base.getindex(::AbstractTensorMap, args...)
Base.setindex!(::AbstractTensorMap, args...)
```

The tensor data can also be filled with random numbers via
```@docs
Random.rand!
Random.randn!
Random.randexp!
```

## `AbstractTensorMap` operations

The operations that can be performed on an `AbstractTensorMap` can be organized into the following categories:

*   *vector operations*: these do not change the `space` or index structure of a tensor and can be straightforwardly implemented on the full data.
    All the methods described in [VectorInterface.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/VectorInterface.jl) are supported.
    For compatibility reasons, we also provide implementations for equivalent methods from LinearAlgebra.jl, such as `axpy!`, `axpby!`.

*   *index manipulations*: these change (permute) the index structure of a tensor, which affects the data in a way that is fully determined by the categorical data of the `sectortype` of the tensor.

*   *(planar) contractions* and *(planar) traces* (i.e., contractions with identity tensors).
    Tensor contractions correspond to a combination of some index manipulations followed by a composition or multiplication of the tensors in their role as linear maps.
    Tensor contractions are however of such importance and frequency that they require a dedicated implementation.

*   *tensor factorizations*, which rely on their identification of tensors with linear maps between tensor spaces.
    The factorizations are applied as ordinary matrix factorizations to the matrix blocks associated with the coupled charges.

### Index manipulations

A general index manipulation of a `TensorMap` object can be built up by considering some transformation of the fusion trees, along with a permutation of the stored data.
They come in three flavours, which are either of the type `transform(!)` which are exported, or of the type `add_transform!`, for additional expert-mode options that allows for addition and scaling, as well as the selection of a custom backend.

```@docs
permute(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Index2Tuple)
braid(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Index2Tuple, ::IndexTuple)
transpose(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Index2Tuple)
repartition(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Int, ::Int)
flip(t::AbstractTensorMap, I)
twist(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Int)
insertleftunit(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Val{i}) where {i}
insertrightunit(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Val{i}) where {i}
removeunit(::AbstractTensorMap, ::Val{i}) where {i}
```

```@docs
permute!(::AbstractTensorMap, ::AbstractTensorMap, ::Index2Tuple)
braid!
transpose!
repartition!
twist!
```

### Tensor map composition, traces, contractions and tensor products

⊗(::AbstractTensorMap, ::AbstractTensorMap)
```

## `TensorMap` factorizations

The factorization methods are powered by [MatrixAlgebraKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/MatrixAlgebraKit.jl) and all follow the same strategy.
The idea is that the `TensorMap` is interpreted as a linear map based on the current partition of indices between `domain` and `codomain`, and then the entire range of MatrixAlgebraKit functions can be called.
Factorizing a tensor according to a different partition of the indices is possible by prepending the factorization step with an explicit call to [`permute`](@ref) or [`transpose`](@ref).

For the full list of factorizations, see [Decompositions](@extref MatrixAlgebraKit).

Additionally, it is possible to obtain truncated versions of some of these factorizations through the [`MatrixAlgebraKit.TruncationStrategy`](@ref) objects.

The exact truncation strategy can be controlled through the strategies defined in [Truncations](@extref MatrixAlgebraKit), but for `TensorMap`s there is also the special-purpose scheme:

```@docs
truncspace
```
