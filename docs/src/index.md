## Package summary

TensorKit.jl aims to be a generic package for working with tensors as they appear throughout the physical sciences.
TensorKit implements a parametric type [`Tensor`](@ref) (which is actually a specific case of the type [`TensorMap`](@ref)) and defines for these types a number of vector space operations (scalar multiplication, addition, norms and inner products), index operations (permutations) and linear algebra operations (multiplication, factorizations).
Finally, tensor contractions can be performed using the `@tensor` macro from [TensorOperations.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/TensorOperations.jl).

Currently, most effort is oriented towards tensors as they appear in the context of quantum many-body physics and in particular the field of tensor networks.
Such tensors often have large dimensions and take on a specific structure when symmetries are present.
By employing concepts from category theory, we can represent and manipulate tensors with a large variety of symmetries, including abelian and non-abelian symmetries, fermionic statistics, as well as generalized (a.k.a. non-invertible or anyonic) symmetries.

At the same time, TensorKit.jl focusses on computational efficiency and performance.
The underlying storage of a tensor's data can be any `DenseArray`.
When the data is stored in main memory (corresponding to `Array`), multiple CPUs can be leveraged as many operations come with multithreaded implementations, either by distributing the different blocks in case of a structured tensor (i.e. with symmetries) or by using multithreading provided by the package [Strided.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/Strided.jl).
Support for storing and manipulating tensors on Nvidia and AMD GPUs is currently being developed, whereas support for distributed arrays is planned for the future.
