# TensorKit.jl

*A Julia package for large-scale tensor computations, with a hint of category theory.*

## Package summary

TensorKit.jl aims to be a generic package for working with tensors as they appear throughout
the physical sciences. TensorKit implements a parametric type [`Tensor`](@ref) (which is actually
a specific case of the type [`TensorMap`](@ref)) and defines for these types a number of
vector space operations (scalar multiplication, addition, norms and inner products), index
operations (permutations) and linear algebra operations (multiplication, factorizations). Finally,
tensor contractions can be performed using the `@tensor` macro from [TensorOperations.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/TensorOperations.jl).

Currently, most effort is oriented towards tensors as they appear in the context of quantum
many body physics and in particular the field of tensor networks. Such tensors often have
large dimensions and take on a specific structure when symmetries are present. To deal with generic
symmetries, we employ notations and concepts from category all the way down to the definition
of a tensor.

At the same time, TensorKit.jl focusses on computational efficiency and performance. The underlying
storage of a tensor's data can be any `DenseArray`. Currently, certain operations are already
multithreaded, either by distributing the different blocks in case of a structured tensor
(i.e. with symmetries) or by using multithreading provided by the package [`Strided.jl`](https://github.com/Jutho/Strided.jl).
In the future, we also plan to investigate using `GPUArray`s as underlying storage for the tensors
data, so as to leverage GPUs for the different operations defined on tensors.
