# [Tutorial](@id s_tutorial)

Before discussing at length all aspects of this package, both its usage and implementation,
we start with a short tutorial to sketch the main capabilities. Thereto, we start by
loading TensorKit.jl

```@repl tutorial
using TensorKit
```

## Cartesian tensors

The most important objects in TensorKit.jl are tensors, which we now create with random
(normally distributed) entries in the following manner
```@repl tutorial
A = Tensor(randn, ℝ^3 ⊗ ℝ^2 ⊗ ℝ^4)
```
Note that we entered the tensor size not as plain dimensions, by specifying the vector
space associated with these tensor indices, in this case `ℝ^n`, which can be obtained by
typing `\bbR+TAB`. The tensor then lives in the tensor product of the different spaces,
which we can obtain by typing `⊗` (i.e. `\otimes+TAB`), although for simplicity also the
usual multiplication sign `*` does the job. Note also that `A` is printed as an instance of
a parametric type `TensorMap`, which we will discuss below and contains `Tensor`.

Briefly sidetracking into the nature of `ℝ^n`:
```@repl tutorial
V = ℝ^3
typeof(V)
V == CartesianSpace(3)
supertype(CartesianSpace)
supertype(EuclideanSpace)
supertype(InnerProductSpace)
supertype(ElementarySpace)
```
i.e. `ℝ^n` can also be created without Unicode using the longer syntax `CartesianSpace(n)`.
It is subtype of `EuclideanSpace{ℝ}`, a space with a standard (Euclidean) inner product
over the real numbers. Furthermore,
```@repl tutorial
W = ℝ^3 ⊗ ℝ^2 ⊗ ℝ^4
typeof(W)
supertype(ProductSpace)
supertype(CompositeSpace)
```
i.e. the tensor product of a number of `CartesianSpace`s is some generic parametric
`ProductSpace` type, specifically `ProductSpace{CartesianSpace,N}` for the tensor product of `N` instances of `CartesianSpace`.

Tensors are themselves vectors (but not `Vector`s), so we can compute linear combinations,
provided they live in the same space.
```@repl tutorial
B = Tensor(randn, ℝ^3 * ℝ^2 * ℝ^4);
C = 0.5*A + 2.5*B
```

Given that they behave as vectors, they also have a scalar product and norm, which they
inherit from the Euclidean inner product on the individual `ℝ^n` spaces:
```@repl tutorial
scalarBA = dot(B,A)
scalarAA = dot(A,A)
normA² = norm(A)^2
```

If two tensors live on different spaces, these operations have no meaning and are thus not
allowed
```@repl tutorial
B′ = Tensor(randn, ℝ^4 * ℝ^2 * ℝ^3);
space(B′) == space(A)
C′ = 0.5*A + 2.5*B′
scalarBA′ = dot(B′,A)
```

However, in this particular case, we can reorder the indices of `B′` to match space of `A`,
using the routine `permute` (we deliberately choose not to overload `permutedims` from
Julia Base, for reasons that become clear below):
```@repl tutorial
space(permute(B′,(3,2,1))) == space(A)
```

We can contract two tensors using Einstein summation convention, which takes the interface
from [TensorOperations.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/TensorOperations.jl). TensorKit.jl
reexports the `@tensor` macro
```@repl tutorial
@tensor D[a,b,c,d] := A[a,b,e]*B[d,c,e]
@tensor d = A[a,b,c]*A[a,b,c]
d ≈ scalarAA ≈ normA²
```
We hope that the index convention is clear. The `:=` is to create a new tensor `D`, without
the `:` the result would be written in an existing tensor `D`, which in this case would
yield an error as no tensor `D` exists. If the contraction yields a scalar, regular
assignment with `=` can be used.

Finally, we can factorize a tensor, creating a bipartition of a subset of its indices and
its complement. With a plain Julia `Array`, one would apply `permutedims` and `reshape` to
cast the array into a matrix before applying e.g. the singular value decomposition. With
TensorKit.jl, one just specifies which indices go to the left (rows) and right (columns)
```@repl tutorial
U, S, Vd = tsvd(A, (1,3), (2,));
@tensor A′[a,b,c] := U[a,c,d]*S[d,e]*Vd[e,b];
A ≈ A′
U
```
Note that the `tsvd` routine returns the decomposition of the linear map as three factors,
`U`, `S` and `Vd`, each of them a `TensorMap`, such that `Vd` is already what is commonly
called `V'`. Furthermore, observe that `U` is printed differently then `A`, i.e. as a
`TensorMap((ℝ^3 ⊗ ℝ^4) ← ProductSpace(ℝ^2))`. What this means is that tensors (or more
appropriately, `TensorMap` instances) in TensorKit.jl are always considered to be linear
maps between two `ProductSpace` instances, with
```@repl tutorial
codomain(U)
domain(U)
codomain(A)
domain(A)
```
Hence, a `Tensor` instance such as `A` is just a specific case of `TensorMap` with an empty
domain, i.e. a `ProductSpace{CartesianSpace,0}` instance. In particular, we can represent a
vector `v` and matrix `m` as
```@repl tutorial
v = Tensor(randn, ℝ^3)
m1 = TensorMap(randn, ℝ^4, ℝ^3)
m2 = TensorMap(randn, ℝ^4 → ℝ^2) # alternative syntax for TensorMap(randn, ℝ^2, ℝ^4)
w = m1 * v # matrix vector product
m3 = m2*m1 # matrix matrix product
```
Note that for the construction of `m1`, in accordance with how one specifies the dimensions
of a matrix (e.g. `randn(4,3)`), the first space is the codomain and the second the domain.
This is somewhat opposite to the general notation for a function `f:domain→codomain`, so
that we also support this more mathemical notation, as illustrated in the construction of
`m2`. In fact, there is a third syntax which mixes both and reads as
`TensorMap(randn, codomain←domain)`.

This 'matrix vector' or 'matrix matrix' product can be computed between any two `TensorMap`
instances for which the domain of the first matches with the codomain of the second, e.g.
```@repl tutorial
v′ = v ⊗ v
m1′ = m1 ⊗ m1
w′ = m1′ * v′
w′ ≈ w ⊗ w
```
Another example involves checking that `U` from the singular value decomposition is a unitary, or at least a left isometric tensor
```@repl tutorial
codomain(U)
domain(U)
space(U)
U'*U # should be the identity on the corresponding domain = codomain
U'*U ≈ one(U'*U)
P = U*U' # should be a projector
P*P ≈ P
```
Here, the adjoint of a `TensorMap` results in a new tensor map (actually a simple wrapper
of type `AdjointTensorMap <: AbstractTensorMap`) with domain and codomain interchanged.

Our original tensor `A` living in `ℝ^4 * ℝ^2 * ℝ^3` is isomorphic to e.g. a linear map
`ℝ^3 → ℝ^4 * ℝ^2`. This is where the full power of `permute` emerges. It allows to
specify a permutation where some indices go to the codomain, and others go to the domain,
as in
```@repl tutorial
A2 = permute(A,(1,2),(3,))
codomain(A2)
domain(A2)
```
In fact, `tsvd(A, (1,3),(2,))` is a shorthand for `tsvd(permute(A,(1,3),(2,)))`, where
`tsvd(A::TensorMap)` will just compute the singular value decomposition according to the
given codomain and domain of `A`.

Note, finally, that the `@tensor` macro treats all indices at the same footing and thus
does not distinguish between codomain and domain. The linear numbering is first all indices
in the codomain, followed by all indices in the domain. However, when `@tensor` creates a
new tensor (i.e. when using `:=`), the default syntax always creates a `Tensor`, i.e. with
all indices in the codomain.
```@repl tutorial
@tensor A′[a,b,c] := U[a,c,d]*S[d,e]*Vd[e,b];
codomain(A′)
domain(A′)
@tensor A2′[(a,b);(c,)] := U[a,c,d]*S[d,e]*Vd[e,b];
codomain(A2′)
domain(A2′)
@tensor A2′′[a b; c] := U[a,c,d]*S[d,e]*Vd[e,b];
A2 ≈ A2′ == A2′′
```
As illustrated for `A2′` and `A2′′`, additional syntax is available that enables one to
immediately specify the desired codomain and domain indices.

## Complex tensors

For applications in e.g. quantum physics, we of course want to work with complex tensors.
Trying to create a complex-valued tensor with `CartesianSpace` indices is of course
somewhat contrived and prints a (one-time) warning
```@repl tutorial
A = Tensor(randn, ComplexF64, ℝ^3 ⊗ ℝ^2 ⊗ ℝ^4)
```
although most of the above operations will work in the expected way (at your own risk).
Indeed, we instead want to work with complex vector spaces
```@repl tutorial
A = Tensor(randn, ComplexF64, ℂ^3 ⊗ ℂ^2 ⊗ ℂ^4)
```
where `ℂ` is obtained as `\bbC+TAB` and we also have the non-Unicode alternative `ℂ^n == ComplexSpace(n)`. Most functionality works exactly the same
```@repl tutorial
B = Tensor(randn, ℂ^3 * ℂ^2 * ℂ^4);
C = im*A + (2.5-0.8im)*B
scalarBA = dot(B,A)
scalarAA = dot(A,A)
normA² = norm(A)^2
U,S,Vd = tsvd(A,(1,3),(2,));
@tensor A′[a,b,c] := U[a,c,d]*S[d,e]*Vd[e,b];
A′ ≈ A
permute(A,(1,3),(2,)) ≈ U*S*Vd
```

However, trying the following
```@repl tutorial
@tensor D[a,b,c,d] := A[a,b,e]*B[d,c,e]
@tensor d = A[a,b,c]*A[a,b,c]
```
we obtain `SpaceMismatch` errors. The reason for this is that, with `ComplexSpace`, an
index in a space `ℂ^n` can only be contracted with an index in the dual space
`dual(ℂ^n) == (ℂ^n)'`. Because of the complex Euclidean inner product, the dual space is
equivalent to the complex conjugate space, but not the the space itself.
```@repl tutorial
dual(ℂ^3) == conj(ℂ^3) == (ℂ^3)'
(ℂ^3)' == ℂ^3
@tensor d = conj(A[a,b,c])*A[a,b,c]
d ≈ normA²
```
This might seem overly strict or puristic, but we believe that it can help to catch errors,
e.g. unintended contractions. In particular, contracting two indices both living in `ℂ^n`
would represent an operation that is not invariant under arbitrary unitary basis changes.

It also makes clear the isomorphism between linear maps `ℂ^n → ℂ^m` and tensors in
`ℂ^m ⊗ (ℂ^n)'`:
```@repl tutorial
m = TensorMap(randn, ComplexF64, ℂ^3, ℂ^4)
m2 = permute(m, (1,2), ())
codomain(m2)
space(m, 1)
space(m, 2)
```
Hence, spaces become their corresponding dual space if they are 'permuted' from the domain
to the codomain or vice versa. Also, spaces in the domain are reported as their dual when
probing them with `space(A, i)`. Generalizing matrix vector and matrix matrix multiplication
to arbitrary tensor contractions require that the two indices to be contracted have spaces
which are each others dual. Knowing this, all the other functionality of tensors with
`CartesianSpace` indices remains the same for tensors with `ComplexSpace` indices.

## Symmetries
So far, the functionality that we have illustrated seems to be just a convenience (or
inconvenience?) wrapper around dense multidimensional arrays, e.g. Julia's Base `Array`.
More power becomes visible when involving symmetries. With symmetries, we imply that there
is some symmetry action defined on every vector space associated with each of the indices
of a `TensorMap`, and the `TensorMap` is then required to be equivariant, i.e. it acts as
an intertwiner between the tensor product representation on the domain and that on the
codomain. By Schur's lemma, this means that the tensor is block diagonal in some basis
corresponding to the irreducible representations that can be coupled to by combining the
different representations on the different spaces in the domain or codomain. For Abelian
symmetries, this does not require a basis change and it just imposes that the tensor has
some block sparsity. Let's clarify all of this with some examples.

We start with a simple ``ℤ₂`` symmetry:
```@repl tutorial
V1 = ℤ₂Space(0=>3,1=>2)
dim(V1)
V2 = ℤ₂Space(0=>1,1=>1)
dim(V2)
A = Tensor(randn, V1*V1*V2')
convert(Array, A)
```
Here, we create a five-dimensional space `V1`, which has a three-dimensional subspace
associated with charge 0 (the trivial irrep of ``ℤ₂``) and a two-dimensional subspace with
charge 1 (the non-trivial irrep). Similar for `V2`, where both subspaces are one-dimensional. 
Representing the tensor as a dense `Array`, we see that it is zero in those
regions where the charges don't add to zero (modulo 2). Of course, the `Tensor(Map)` type
in TensorKit.jl won't store these zero blocks, and only stores the non-zero information,
which we can recognize also in the full `Array` representation.

From there on, the resulting tensors support all of the same operations as the ones we
encountered in the previous examples.
```@repl tutorial
B = Tensor(randn, V1'*V1*V2);
@tensor C[a,b] := A[a,c,d]*B[c,b,d]
U,S,V = tsvd(A,(1,3),(2,));
U'*U # should be the identity on the corresponding domain = codomain
U'*U ≈ one(U'*U)
P = U*U' # should be a projector
P*P ≈ P
```

We also support other abelian symmetries, e.g.
```@repl tutorial
V = U₁Space(0=>2,1=>1,-1=>1)
dim(V)
A = TensorMap(randn, V*V, V)
dim(A)
convert(Array, A)

V = GradedSpace[Irrep[U₁×ℤ₂]]((0,0)=>2,(1,1)=>1,(-1,0)=>1)
dim(V)
A = TensorMap(randn, V*V, V)
dim(A)
convert(Array, A)
```
Here, the `dim` of a `TensorMap` returns the number of linearly independent components,
i.e. the number of non-zero entries in the case of an abelian symmetry. Also note that we
can use `×` (obtained as `\times+TAB`) to combine different symmetries. The general space
associated with symmetries is a `GradedSpace`. Although this is actually an
abstract type, it is the access point for users to construct spaces with arbitrary
symmetries, and `ℤ₂Space` (also `Z2Space` as non-Unicode alternative) and `U₁Space` (or
`U1Space`) are just convenient synonyms, e.g.
```@repl tutorial
GradedSpace[Irrep[U₁]](0=>3,1=>2,-1=>1) == U1Space(-1=>1,1=>2,0=>3)
V = U₁Space(1=>2,0=>3,-1=>1)
for s in sectors(V)
  @show s, dim(V, s)
end
U₁Space(-1=>1,0=>3,1=>2) == GradedSpace(Irrep[U₁](1)=>2, Irrep[U₁](0)=>3, Irrep[U₁](-1)=>1)
supertype(GradedSpace)
```
Note that `GradedSpace` is not immediately parameterized by some group `G`, but actually by
the set of irreducible representations of `G`, denoted as `Irrep[G]`. Indeed, `GradedSpace`
also supports a grading that is derived from the fusion ring of a (unitary) pre-fusion
category. Also note that the order in which the charges and their corresponding subspace
dimensionality are specified is irrelevant, and that the charges, henceforth called sectors
(which is a more general name for charges or quantum numbers) are of a specific type, in
this case `Irrep[U₁] == U1Irrep`. However, the `GradedSpace[I]` constructor automatically
converts the keys in the list of `Pair`s it receives to the correct type. Alternatively, we
can directly create the sectors of the correct type and use the generic `GradedSpace`

constructor. We can probe the subspace dimension of a certain sector `s` in a space `V`
with `dim(V, s)`. Finally, note that `GradedSpace` is also a subtype of
`EuclideanSpace{ℂ}`, which implies that it still has the standard Euclidean inner product
and we assume all representations to be unitary.

TensorKit.jl also allows for non-abelian symmetries such as `SU₂`. In this case, the vector
space is characterized via the spin quantum number (i.e. the irrep label of `SU₂`) for each
of its subspaces, and is created using `SU₂Space` (or `SU2Space` or
`GradedSpace[Irrep[SU₂]]`)
```@repl tutorial
V = SU₂Space(0=>2,1/2=>1,1=>1)
dim(V)
V == GradedSpace[Irrep[SU₂]](0=>2, 1=>1, 1//2=>1)
```
Note that now `V` has a two-dimensional subspace with spin zero, and two one-dimensional
subspaces with spin 1/2 and spin 1. However, a subspace with spin `j` has an additional
`2j+1` dimensional degeneracy on which the irreducible representation acts. This brings the
total dimension to `2*1 + 1*2 + 1*3`. Creating a tensor with `SU₂` symmetry yields
```@repl tutorial
A = TensorMap(randn, V*V, V)
dim(A)
convert(Array, A)
norm(A) ≈ norm(convert(Array, A))
```
In this case, the full `Array` representation of the tensor has again many zeros, but it is
less obvious to recognize the dense blocks, as there are additional zeros and the numbers
in the original tensor data do not match with those in the `Array`. The reason is of course
that the original tensor data now needs to be transformed with a construction known as
fusion trees, which are made up out of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the group.
Indeed, note that the non-zero blocks are also no longer labeled by a list of sectors, but
by pair of fusion trees. This will be explained further in the manual. However, the
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the group are only needed to actually convert a tensor to an
`Array`. For working with tensors with `SU₂Space` indices, e.g. contracting or factorizing
them, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are never needed explicitly. Instead, recoupling
relations are used to symbolically manipulate the basis of fusion trees, and this only
requires what is known as the topological data of the group (or its representation theory).

In fact, this formalism extends beyond the case of group representations on vector spaces,
and can also deal with super vector spaces (to describe fermions) and more general
(unitary) fusion categories. Preliminary support for these generalizations is present in
TensorKit.jl and will be extended in the near future.

All of these concepts will be explained throughout the remainder of this manual, including
several details regarding their implementation. However, to just use tensors and their
manipulations (contractions, factorizations, ...) in higher level algorithms (e.g. tensor
network algorithms), one does not need to know or understand most of these details, and one
can immediately refer to the general interface of the `TensorMap` type, discussed on the
[last page](@ref s_tensors). Adhering to this interface should yield code and algorithms
that are oblivious to the underlying symmetries and can thus work with arbitrary symmetric
tensors.
