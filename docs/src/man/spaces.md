# Vector spaces

```@setup tensorkit
using TensorKit
```

From the [Introduction](@ref), it should be clear that an important aspect in the definition
of a tensor (map) is specifying the vector spaces and their structure in the domain and codomain
of the map. The starting point is an abstract type `VectorSpace`
```julia
abstract type VectorSpace end
```
which serves in a sense as the category ``Vect``. All instances of subtypes of `VectorSpace`
will represent vector spaces. In particular, we define two abstract subtypes
```julia
abstract type ElementarySpace{𝕜} <: VectorSpace end
const IndexSpace = ElementarySpace

abstract type CompositeSpace{S<:ElementarySpace} <: VectorSpace end
```
Here, `ElementarySpace` is a super type for all vector spaces that can be associated with the
individual indices of a tensor, as hinted to by its alias `IndexSpace`. It is parametrically
dependent on `𝕜`, the field of scalars (see the next section on [Fields](@ref)).

On the other hand, subtypes of `CompositeSpace{S}` where `S<:ElementarySpace` are composed of
a number of elementary spaces of type `S`. So far, there is a single concrete type `ProductSpace{S,N}`
that represents the homogeneous tensor product of `N` vector spaces of type `S`. Its properties
are discussed in the section on [Composite spaces](@ref), together with possible extensions
for the future.

## Fields

Vector spaces are defined over a field of scalars. We define a type hierarchy to specify the
scalar field, but so far only support real and complex numbers, via
```julia
abstract type Field end

struct RealNumbers <: Field end
struct ComplexNumbers <: Field end

const ℝ = RealNumbers()
const ℂ = ComplexNumbers()
```
Note that `ℝ` and `ℂ` can be typed as `\bbR`+TAB and `\bbC`+TAB. One reason for defining this
new type hierarchy instead of recycling the types from Julia's `Number` hierarchy is to introduce
some syntactic suggar without commiting type piracy. In particular, we now have
```@repl tensorkit
3 ∈ ℝ
5.0 ∈ ℂ
5.0+1.0*im ∈ ℝ
Float64 ⊆ ℝ
ComplexF64 ⊆ ℂ
ℝ ⊆ ℂ
ℂ ⊆ ℝ
```
and furthermore ––probably more usefully–– `ℝ^n` and `ℂ^n` create specific elementary vector
spaces as described in the next section. The underlying field of a vector space or tensor
`a` can be obtained with `field(a)`.

## Elementary vector spaces

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, vector spaces that are associated with the
individual indices of a tensor should be implemented as subtypes of `ElementarySpace`. As
the domain and codomain of a tensor map will be the tensor product of such objects which all
have the same type, it is important that related vector spaces, e.g. the dual space, are objects
of the same concrete type (i.e. with the same type parameters in case of a parametric type).
In particular, every `ElementarySpace` should implement the following methods

*   `dim(::ElementarySpace) -> ::Int`  
    return the dimension of the space as an `Int`

*   `dual{S<:ElementarySpace}(::S) -> ::S`  
    return the [dual space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space) `dual(V)`, using an instance
    of the same concrete type (i.e. not via type parameters); this should satisfy `dual(dual(V)==V`

*   `conj{S<:ElementarySpace}(::S) -> ::S`  
    return the [complex conjugate space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate_vector_space)
    `conj(V)`, using an instance of the same concrete type (i.e. not via type parameters); this
    should satisfy `conj(conj(V))==V` and we automatically have `conj{F<:Real}(V::ElementarySpace{F}) = V`.

For convenience, the dual of a space `V` can also be obtained as `V'`.

There is concrete type `GeneralSpace` which is completely characterized by its field `𝕜`,
its dimension and whether its the dual and/or complex conjugate of $𝕜^d$ .
```julia
struct GeneralSpace{𝕜} <: ElementarySpace{𝕜}
    d::Int
    dual::Bool
    conj::Bool
end
```

We furthermore define the abstract type
```julia
abstract InnerProductSpace{𝕜} <: ElementarySpace{𝕜}
```
to contain all vector spaces `V` which have an inner product and thus a canonical mapping from
`dual(V)` to `V` (for `𝕜 ⊆ ℝ`) or from `dual(V)` to `conj(V)` (otherwise). This mapping
is provided by the metric, but no further support for working with metrics is currently implemented.

Finally there is
```julia
abstract EuclideanSpace{𝕜} <: InnerProductSpace{𝕜}
```
to contain all spaces `V` with a standard Euclidean inner product (i.e. where the metric is
the identity). These spaces have the natural isomorphisms `dual(V) == V` (for ` 𝕜<:Real`) or
`dual(V) == conj(V)` (for ` 𝕜<:Complex`). In particular, we have two concrete types
```julia
immutable CartesianSpace <: EuclideanSpace{ℝ}
    d::Int
end
immutable ComplexSpace <: EuclideanSpace{ℂ}
  d::Int
  dual::Bool
end
```
to represent the Euclidean spaces $ℝ^d$ or $ℂ^d$ without further inner structure. They can be
created using the syntax `ℝ^d` and `ℂ^d`, or `(ℂ^d)'`for the dual space of the latter. Note
that the brackets are required because of the precedence rules, since `d' == d` for `d::Integer``.
Some examples
```@repl tensorkit
dim(ℝ^10)
(ℝ^10)' == ℝ^10
isdual((ℂ^5))
isdual((ℂ^5)')
isdual((ℝ^5)')
dual(ℂ^5) == (ℂ^5)' == conj(ℂ^5)
```
We refer to the next section on [Sectors, representation spaces and fusion trees](@ref) for
further information about `RepresentationSpace`, which is a subtype of `EuclideanSpace{ℂ}` with
an inner structure corresponding to the irreducible representations of a group.

## Composite spaces

Composite spaces are vector spaces that are built up out of individual elementary vector spaces.
The most prominent (and currently only) example is a tensor product of `N` elementary spaces
of the same type `S`, which is implemented as
```julia
struct ProductSpace{S<:ElementarySpace, N} <: CompositeSpace{S}
    spaces::NTuple{N, S}
end
```
Given some `V1::S`, `V2::S`, `V3::S` of the same type `S<:ElementarySpace`, we can easily
construct `ProductSpace{S,3}((V1,V2,V3))` as `ProductSpace(V1,V2,V3)` or using `V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ V3`,
where `⊗` is simply obtained by typing `\otimes`+TAB. In fact, for convience, even the regular
multiplication operator `*` acts as tensor product between vector spaces, and as a consequence
so does raising a vector space to a positive integer power, i.e.
```@repl tensorkit
V1 = ℂ^2
V2 = ℂ^3
V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ V1' == V1 * V2 * V1' == ProductSpace(V1,V2,V1') == ProductSpace(V1,V2) ⊗ V1'
V1^3
dim(V1 ⊗ V2)
dual(V1 ⊗ V2)
```
Note that the rationale for the last result was explained in the subsection [Duals](@ref) of
[Properties of monoidal categories](@ref).

Following Julia's Base library, the function `one` applied to a `ProductSpace{S,N}` returns
the multiplicative identity, which is `ProductSpace{S,0}`. The same result is obtained when
acting on an instance `V` of `S::ElementarySpace` directly, however note that `V ⊗ one(V)` will
yield a `ProductSpace{S,1}(V)` and not `V` itself. Similar to Julia Base, `one` also works in
the type domain.

In the future, other `CompositeSpace` types could be added. For example, the wave function of
an `N`-particle quantum system in first quantization would require the introduction of a `SymmetricSpace{S,N}`
or a `AntiSymmetricSpace{S,N}` for bosons or fermions respectively, which correspond to the
symmetric (permutation invariant) or antisymmetric subspace of `V^N`, where `V::S` represents
the Hilbert space of the single particle system. Other domains, like general relativity, might
also benefit from tensors living in a subspace with certain symmetries under specific index
permutations.

## Some more functionality
Some more convenience functions are provided for the euclidean spaces [`CartesianSpace`](@ref)
and [`ComplexSpace`](@ref), as well as for [`RepresentationSpace`](@ref) discussed in the next
section. All functions below that act on more than a single elementary space, are only defined
when the different spaces are of the same concrete subtype `S<:ElementarySpace`

The function `fuse(V1, V2, ...)` or `fuse(V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ ...)` returns an elementary space that is
isomorphic to `V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ ...`, in the sense that a unitary tensor map can be constructed between
those spaces, e.g. from `W = V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ ...` to `V = fuse(V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ ...)`. The function `flip(V1)`
returns a space that is isomorphic to `V1` but has `isdual(flip(V1)) == isdual(V1')`, i.e. if
`V1` is a normal space than `flip(V1)` is a dual space. Again, isomorphism here implies that
a unitary map (but there is no canonical choice) can be constructed between both spaces. `flip(V1)`
is different from `dual(V1)` in the case of [`RepresentationSpace`](@ref). It is useful to
flip a tensor index from a ket to a bra (or vice versa), by contracting that index with a unitary
map from `V1` to `map(V1)`. We refer to `[Index operations](@ref)` for further information.
Some examples
```@repl tensorkit
fuse(ℝ^5, ℝ^3)
fuse(ℂ^3, (ℂ^5)', ℂ^2)
flip(ℂ^4)
```

We also define the direct sum `V1` and `V2` as `V1 ⊕ V2`, where `⊕` is obtained by typing
`\oplus`+TAB. This is possible only if `isdual(V1) == isdual(V2)`. With a little pun on Julia
Base, `oneunit` applied to an elementary space (in the value or type domain) returns the one-dimensional
space, which is isomorphic to the scalar field of the spaceitself. Some examples illustrate
this better
```@repl tensorkit
ℝ^5 ⊕ ℝ^3
ℂ^5 ⊕ ℂ^3
ℂ^5 ⊕ (ℂ^3)'
oneunit(ℝ^3)
ℂ^5 ⊕ oneunit(ComplexSpace)
oneunit((ℂ^3)')
(ℂ^5) ⊕ oneunit((ℂ^5))
(ℂ^5)' ⊕ oneunit((ℂ^5)')
```

For two spaces `V1` and `V2`, `min(V1,V2)` returns the space with the smallest dimension, whereas
`max(V1,V2)` returns the space with the largest dimension, as illustrated by
```@repl tensorkit
min(ℝ^5, ℝ^3)
max(ℂ^5, ℂ^3)
max(ℂ^5, (ℂ^3)')
```
Again, we impose `isdual(V1) == isdual(V2)`. Again, the use of these methods is to construct
unitary or isometric tensors that map between different spaces, which will be elaborated upon
in the section on Tensors
