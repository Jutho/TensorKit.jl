# [Tensors and the `TensorMap` type](@id s_tensors)

```@setup tensors
using TensorKit

```

This last page explains how to create and manipulate tensors in TensorKit.jl. As this is
probably the most important part of the manual, we will also focus more strongly on the
usage and interface, and less so on the underlying implementation. The only aspect of the
implementation that we will address is the storage of the tensor data, as this is important
to know how to create and initialize a tensor, but will in fact also shed light on how some
of the methods work.

As mentioned, all tensors in TensorKit.jl are interpreted as linear maps (morphisms) from a
domain (a `ProductSpace{S,N₂}`) to a codomain (another `ProductSpace{S,N₁}`), with the same
`S<:ElementarySpace` that labels the type of spaces associated with the individual tensor
indices. The overall type for all such tensor maps is `AbstractTensorMap{S, N₁, N₂}`. Note
that we place information about the codomain before that of the domain. Indeed, we have
already encountered the constructor for the concrete parametric type `TensorMap` in the
form `TensorMap(..., codomain, domain)`. This convention is opposite to the mathematical
notation, e.g. ``\mathrm{Hom}(W,V)`` or ``f:W→V``, but originates from the fact that a
normal matrix is also denoted as having size `m × n` or is constructed in Julia as
`Array(..., (m, n))`, where the first integer `m` refers to the codomain being `m`-
dimensional, and the seond integer `n` to the domain being `n`-dimensional. This also
explains why we have consistently used the symbol ``W`` for spaces in the domain and ``V``
for spaces in the codomain. A tensor map ``t:(W₁ ⊗ … ⊗ W_{N₂}) → (V₁ ⊗ … ⊗ V_{N₁})`` will
be created in Julia as `TensorMap(..., V1 ⊗ ... ⊗ VN₁, W1 ⊗ ... ⊗ WN2)`.

Furthermore, the abstract type `AbstractTensor{S,N}` is just a synonym for
`AbstractTensorMap{S,N,0}`, i.e. for tensor maps with an empty domain, which is equivalent
to the unit of the monoidal category, or thus, the field of scalars ``𝕜``.

Currently, `AbstractTensorMap` has two subtypes. `TensorMap` provides the actual
implementation, where the data of the tensor is stored in a `DenseArray` (more specifically
a `DenseMatrix` as will be explained below). `AdjointTensorMap` is a simple wrapper type to
denote the adjoint of an existing `TensorMap` object. In the future, additional types could
be defined, to deal with sparse data, static data, diagonal data, etc...

## [Storage of tensor data](@id ss_tensor_storage)

Before discussion how to construct and initalize a `TensorMap{S}`, let us discuss what is
meant by 'tensor data' and how it can efficiently and compactly be stored. Let us first
discuss the case `sectortype(S) == Trivial` sector, i.e. the case of no symmetries. In that
case the data of a tensor `t = TensorMap(..., V1 ⊗ ... ⊗ VN₁, W1 ⊗ ... ⊗ WN2)` can just be
represented as a multidimensional array of size

`(dim(V1), dim(V2), …, dim(VN₁), dim(W1), …, dim(WN₂))`

which can also be reshaped into matrix of size

`(dim(V1)*dim(V2)*…*dim(VN₁), dim(W1)*dim(W2)*…*dim(WN₂))`

and is really the matrix representation of the linear map that the tensor represents. In
particular, given a second tensor `t2` whose domain matches with the codomain of `t`,
function composition amounts to multiplication of their corresponding data matrices.
Similarly, tensor factorizations such as the singular value decomposition, which we discuss
below, can act directly on this matrix representation.

!!! note
    One might wonder if it would not have been more natural to represent the tensor data as
    `(dim(V1), dim(V2), …, dim(VN₁), dim(WN₂), …, dim(W1))` given how employing the duality
    naturally reverses the tensor product, as encountered with the interface of
    [`repartition`](@ref) for [fusion trees](@ref ss_fusiontrees). However, such a
    representation, when plainly `reshape`d to a matrix, would not have the above
    properties and would thus not constitute the matrix representation of the tensor in a
    compatible basis.

Now consider the case where `sectortype(S) == I` for some `I` which has
`FusionStyle(I) == UniqueFusion()`, i.e. the representations of an Abelian group, e.g.
`I == Irrep[ℤ₂]` or `I == Irrep[U₁]`. In this case, the tensor data is associated with
sectors `(a1, a2, …, aN₁) ∈ sectors(V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ … ⊗ VN₁)` and
`(b1, …, bN₂) ∈ sectors(W1 ⊗ … ⊗ WN₂)` such that they fuse to a same common charge, i.e.
`(c = first(⊗(a1, …, aN₁))) == first(⊗(b1, …, bN₂))`. The data associated with this takes
the form of a multidimensional array with size
`(dim(V1, a1), …, dim(VN₁, aN₁), dim(W1, b1), …, dim(WN₂, bN₂))`, or equivalently, a matrix
of with row size `dim(V1, a1)*…*dim(VN₁, aN₁) == dim(codomain, (a1, …, aN₁))` and column
size `dim(W1, b1)*…*dim(WN₂, aN₂) == dim(domain, (b1, …, bN₂))`.

However, there are multiple combinations of `(a1, …, aN₁)` giving rise to the same `c`, and
so there is data associated with all of these, as well as all possible combinations of
`(b1, …, bN₂)`. Stacking all matrices for different `(a1,…)` and a fixed value of `(b1,…)`
underneath each other, and for fixed value of `(a1,…)` and different values of `(b1,…)` next
to each other, gives rise to a larger block matrix of all data associated with the central
sector `c`. The size of this matrix is exactly
`(blockdim(codomain, c), blockdim(domain, c))` and these matrices are exactly the diagonal
blocks whose existence is guaranteed by Schur's lemma, and which are labeled by the coupled
sector `c`. Indeed, if we would represent the tensor map `t` as a matrix without explicitly
using the symmetries, we could reorder the rows and columns to group data corresponding to
sectors that fuse to the same `c`, and the resulting block diagonal representation would
emerge. This basis transform is thus a permutation, which is a unitary operation, that will
cancel or go through trivially for linear algebra operations such as composing tensor maps
(matrix multiplication) or tensor factorizations such as a singular value decomposition. For
such linear algebra operations, we can thus directly act on these large matrices, which
correspond to the diagonal blocks that emerge after a basis transform, provided that the
partition of the tensor indices in domain and codomain of the tensor are in line with our
needs. For example, composing two tensor maps amounts to multiplying the matrices
corresponding to the same `c` (provided that its subblocks labeled by the different
combinations of sectors are ordered in the same way, which we guarantee by associating a
canonical order with sectors). Henceforth, we refer to the `blocks` of a tensor map as those
diagonal blocks, the existence of which is provided by Schur's lemma and which are labeled
by the coupled sectors `c`. We directly store these blocks as `DenseMatrix` and gather them
as values in a dictionary, together with the corresponding coupled sector `c` as key. For a
given tensor `t`, we can access a specific block as `block(t, c)`, whereas `blocks(t)`
yields an iterator over pairs `c=>block(t,c)`.

The subblocks corresponding to a particular combination of sectors then correspond to a
particular view for some range of the rows and some range of the colums, i.e.
`view(block(t, c), m₁:m₂, n₁:n₂)` where the ranges `m₁:m₂` associated with `(a1, …, aN₁)`
and `n₁:n₂` associated with `(b₁, …, bN₂)` are stored within the fields of the instance `t`
of type `TensorMap`. This `view` can then lazily be reshaped to a multidimensional array,
for which we rely on the package [Strided.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/Strided.jl). Indeed,
the data in this `view` is not contiguous, because the stride between the different columns
is larger than the length of the columns. Nonetheless, this does not pose a problem and even
as multidimensional array there is still a definite stride associated with each dimension.

When `FusionStyle(I) isa MultipleFusion`, things become slightly more complicated. Not only
do `(a1, …, aN₁)` give rise to different coupled sectors `c`, there can be multiply ways in
which they fuse to `c`. These different possibilities are enumerated by the iterator
`fusiontrees((a1, …, aN₁), c)` and `fusiontrees((b1, …, bN₂), c)`, and with each of those,
there is tensor data that takes the form of a multidimensional array, or, after reshaping, a
matrix of size `(dim(codomain, (a1, …, aN₁)), dim(domain, (b1, …, bN₂))))`. Again, we can
stack all such matrices with the same value of `f₁ ∈ fusiontrees((a1, …, aN₁), c)`
horizontally (as they all have the same number of rows), and with the same value of `f₂ ∈
fusiontrees((b1, …, bN₂), c)` vertically (as they have the same number of columns). What
emerges is a large matrix of size `(blockdim(codomain, c), blockdim(domain, c))` containing
all the tensor data associated with the coupled sector `c`, where `blockdim(P, c) =
sum(dim(P, s)*length(fusiontrees(s, c)) for s in sectors(P))` for some instance `P` of
`ProductSpace`. The tensor implementation does not distinguish between abelian or
non-abelian sectors and still stores these matrices as a `DenseMatrix`, accessible via
`block(t, c)`.

At first sight, it might now be less clear what the relevance of this block is in relation
to the full matrix representation of the tensor map, where the symmetry is not exploited.
The essential interpretation is still the same. Schur's lemma now tells that there is a
unitary basis transform which makes this matrix representation block diagonal, more
specifically, of the form ``⨁_{c} B_c ⊗ 𝟙_{c}``, where ``B_c`` denotes `block(t,c)` and
``𝟙_{c}`` is an identity matrix of size `(dim(c), dim(c))`. The reason for this extra
identity is that the group representation is recoupled to act as ``⨁_{c} 𝟙 ⊗ u_c(g)`` for
all ``g ∈ \mathsf{I}``, with ``u_c(g)`` the matrix representation of group element ``g``
according to the irrep ``c``. In the abelian case, `dim(c) == 1`, i.e. all irreducible
representations are one-dimensional and Schur's lemma only dictates that all off-diagonal
blocks are zero. However, in this case the basis transform to the block diagonal
representation is not simply a permutation matrix, but a more general unitary matrix
composed of the different fusion trees. Indeed, let us denote the fusion trees `f₁ ∈
fusiontrees((a1, …, aN₁), c)` as ``X^{a_1, …, a_{N₁}}_{c,α}`` where
``α = (e_1, …, e_{N_1-2}; μ₁, …, μ_{N_1-1})`` is a collective label for the internal sectors
`e` and the vertex degeneracy labels `μ` of a generic fusion tree, as discussed in the
[corresponding section](@ref ss_fusiontrees). The tensor is then represented as

```@raw html
<img src="../img/tensor-storage.svg" alt="tensor storage" class="color-invertible"/>
```

In this diagram, we have indicated how the tensor map can be rewritten in terms of a block
diagonal matrix with a unitary matrix on its left and another unitary matrix (if domain and
codomain are different) on its right. So the left and right matrices should actually have
been drawn as squares. They represent the unitary basis transform. In this picture, red and
white regions are zero. The center matrix is most easy to interpret. It is the block
diagonal matrix ``⨁_{c} B_c ⊗ 𝟙_{c}`` with diagonal blocks labeled by the coupled charge
`c`, in this case it takes two values. Every single small square in between the dotted or
dashed lines has size ``d_c × d_c`` and corresponds to a single element of ``B_c``,
tensored with the identity ``\mathrm{id}_c``. Instead of ``B_c``, a more accurate labelling
is ``t^c_{(a_1 … a_{N₁})α, (b_1 … b_{N₂})β}`` where ``α`` labels different fusion trees from
``(a_1 … a_{N₁})`` to ``c``. The dashed horizontal lines indicate regions corresponding to
different fusion (actually splitting) trees, either because of different sectors
``(a_1 … a_{N₁})`` or different labels ``α`` within the same sector. Similarly, the dashed
vertical lines define the border between regions of different fusion trees from the domain
to `c`, either because of different sectors ``(b_1 … b_{N₂})`` or a different label ``β``.

To understand this better, we need to understand the basis transform, e.g. on the left
(codomain) side. In more detail, it is given by

```@raw html
<img src="../img/tensor-unitary.svg" alt="tensor unitary" class="color-invertible"/>
```

Indeed, remembering that ``V_i = ⨁_{a_i} R_{a_i} ⊗ ℂ^{n_{a_i}}`` with ``R_{a_i}`` the
representation space on which irrep ``a_i`` acts (with dimension ``\mathrm{dim}(a_i)``), we
find
``V_1 ⊗ … ⊗ V_{N_1} = ⨁_{a_1, …, a_{N₁}} (R_{a_1} ⊗ … ⊗ R_{a_{N_1}}) ⊗ ℂ^{n_{a_1} × … n_{a_{N_1}}}``.
In the diagram above, the wiggly lines correspond to the direct sum over the different
sectors ``(a_1, …, a_{N₁})``, there depicted taking three possible values ``(a…)``,
``(a…)′`` and ``(a…)′′``. The tensor product
``(R_{a_1} ⊗ … ⊗ R_{a_{N_1}}) ⊗ ℂ^{n_{a_1} × … n_{a_{N_1}}}`` is depicted as
``(R_{a_1} ⊗ … ⊗ R_{a_{N_1}})^{⊕ n_{a_1} × … n_{a_{N_1}}}``, i.e. as a direct sum of the
spaces ``R_{(a…)} = (R_{a_1} ⊗ … ⊗ R_{a_{N_1}})`` according to the dotted horizontal lines,
which repeat ``n_{(a…)} = n_{a_1} × … n_{a_{N_1}}`` times. In this particular example,
``n_{(a…)}=2``, ``n_{(a…)'}=3`` and ``n_{(a…)''}=5``. The thick vertical line represents the
separation between the two different coupled sectors, denoted as ``c`` and ``c'``. Dashed
vertical lines represent different ways of reaching the coupled sector, corresponding to
different `α`. In this example, the first sector ``(a…)`` has one fusion tree to ``c``,
labeled by ``c,α``, and two fusion trees to ``c'``, labeled by ``c',α`` and ``c',α'``. The
second sector has only a fusion tree to ``c``, labeled by ``c,α'``. The third sector only
has a fusion tree to ``c'``, labeld by ``c', α''``. Finally then, because the fusion trees
do not act on the spaces ``ℂ^{n_{a_1} × … n_{a_{N_1}}}``, the dotted lines which represent
the different ``n_{(a…)} = n_{a_1} × … n_{a_{N_1}}`` dimensions are also drawn vertically.
In particular, for a given sector ``(a…)`` and a specific fusion tree
``X^{(a…)}_{c,α}: R_{(a…)}→R_c``, the action is ``X^{(a…)}_{c,α} ⊗ 𝟙_{n_{(a…)}}``, which
corresponds to the diagonal green blocks in this drawing where the same matrix
``X^{(a…)}_{c,α}`` (the fusion tree) is repeated along the diagonal. Note that the fusion
tree is not a vector or single column, but a matrix with number of rows equal to
``\mathrm{dim}(R_{(a\ldots)}) = d_{a_1} d_{a_2} … d_{a_{N_1}} `` and number of columns
equal to ``d_c``. A similar interpretation can be given to the basis transform on the
right, by taking its adjoint. In this particular example, it has two different combinations
of sectors ``(b…)`` and ``(b…)'``, where both have a single fusion tree to ``c`` as well as
to ``c'``, and ``n_{(b…)}=2``, ``n_{(b…)'}=3``.

Note that we never explicitly store or act with the basis transforms on the left and the
right. For composing tensor maps (i.e. multiplying them), these basis transforms just
cancel, whereas for tensor factorizations they just go through trivially. They transform
non-trivially when reshuffling the tensor indices, both within or in between the domain and
codomain. For this, however, we can completely rely on the manipulations of fusion trees to
implicitly compute the effect of the basis transform and construct the new blocks ``B_c``
that result with respect to the new basis.

Hence, as before, we only store the diagonal blocks ``B_c`` of size
`(blockdim(codomain(t), c), blockdim(domain(t), c))` as a `DenseMatrix`, accessible via
`block(t, c)`. Within this matrix, there are regions of the form
`view(block(t, c), m₁:m₂, n₁:n₂)` that correspond to the data
``t^c_{(a_1 … a_{N₁})α, (b_1 … b_{N₂})β}`` associated with a pair of fusion trees
``X^{(a_1 … a_{N₁})}_{c,α}`` and ``X^{(b_1 … b_{N₂})}_{c,β}``, henceforth again denoted as
`f₁` and `f₂`, with `f₁.coupled == f₂.coupled == c`. The ranges where this subblock is
living are managed within the tensor implementation, and these subblocks can be accessed
via `t[f₁,f₂]`, and is returned as a `StridedArray` of size
``n_{a_1} × n_{a_2} × … × n_{a_{N_1}} × n_{b_1} × … n_{b_{N₂}}``, or in code,
`(dim(V1, a1), dim(V2, a2), …, dim(VN₁, aN₁), dim(W1, b1), …, dim(WN₂, bN₂))`. While the
implementation does not distinguish between `FusionStyle isa UniqueFusion` or
`FusionStyle isa MultipleFusion`, in the former case the fusion tree is completely
characterized by the uncoupled sectors, and so the subblocks can also be accessed as
`t[(a1, …, aN₁, b1, …, bN₂)]`. When there is no symmetry at all, i.e.
`sectortype(t) == Trivial`, `t[]` returns the raw tensor data as a `StridedArray` of size
`(dim(V1), …, dim(VN₁), dim(W1), …, dim(WN₂))`, whereas `block(t, Trivial())` returns the
same data as a `DenseMatrix` of size `(dim(V1) * … * dim(VN₁), dim(W1) * … * dim(WN₂))`.

## [Constructing tensor maps and accessing tensor data](@id ss_tensor_construction)

Having learned how a tensor is represented and stored, we can now discuss how to create
tensors and tensor maps. From hereon, we focus purely on the interface rather than the
implementation.

### Random and uninitialized tensor maps
The most convenient set of constructors are those that construct  tensors or tensor maps
with random or uninitialized data. They take the form

```julia
f(codomain, domain = one(codomain))
f(eltype::Type{<:Number}, codomain, domain = one(codomain))
TensorMap(undef, codomain, domain = one(codomain))
TensorMap(undef, eltype::Type{<:Number}, codomain, domain = one(codomain))
Tensor(undef, codomain)
Tensor(undef, eltype::Type{<:Number}, codomain)
```
Here, `f` is any of the typical functions from Base that normally create arrays, namely
`zeros`, `ones`, `rand`, `randn` and `Random.randexp`. Remember that `one(codomain)` is the
empty `ProductSpace{S,0}()`. The third and fourth calling syntax use the `UndefInitializer`
from Julia Base and generates a `TensorMap` with unitialized data, which can thus contain
`NaN`s.

In all of these constructors, the last two arguments can be replaced by `domain→codomain`
or `codomain←domain`, where the arrows are obtained as `\rightarrow+TAB` and
`\leftarrow+TAB` and create a `HomSpace` as explained in the section on
[Spaces of morphisms](@ref ss_homspaces). Some examples are perhaps in order

```@repl tensors
t1 = randn(ℂ^2 ⊗ ℂ^3, ℂ^2)
t2 = zeros(Float32, ℂ^2 ⊗ ℂ^3 ← ℂ^2)
t3 = TensorMap(undef, ℂ^2 → ℂ^2 ⊗ ℂ^3)
domain(t1) == domain(t2) == domain(t3)
codomain(t1) == codomain(t2) == codomain(t3)
disp(x) = show(IOContext(Core.stdout, :compact=>false), "text/plain", trunc.(x; digits = 3));
t1[] |> disp
block(t1, Trivial()) |> disp
reshape(t1[], dim(codomain(t1)), dim(domain(t1))) |> disp
```

Finally, all constructors can also be replaced by `Tensor(..., codomain)`, in which case
the domain is assumed to be the empty `ProductSpace{S,0}()`, which can easily be obtained
as `one(codomain)`. Indeed, the empty product space is the unit object of the monoidal
category, equivalent to the field of scalars `𝕜`, and thus the multiplicative identity
(especially since `*` also acts as tensor product on vector spaces).

The matrices created by `f` are the matrices ``B_c`` discussed above, i.e. those returned
by `block(t, c)`. Only numerical matrices of type `DenseMatrix` are accepted, which in
practice just means Julia's intrinsic `Matrix{T}` for some `T<:Number`. In the future, we
will add support for `CuMatrix` from [CuArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CuArrays.jl)
to harness GPU computing power, and maybe `SharedArray` from the Julia's `SharedArrays`
standard library.

Support for static or sparse data is currently unavailable, and if it would be implemented,
it would lead to new subtypes of `AbstractTensorMap` which are distinct from `TensorMap`.
Future implementations of e.g. `SparseTensorMap` or `StaticTensorMap` could be useful.
Furthermore, there could be specific implementations for tensors whose blocks are
`Diagonal`.

### Tensor maps from existing data

To create a `TensorMap` with existing data, one can use the aforementioned form but with
the function `f` replaced with the actual data, i.e. `TensorMap(data, codomain, domain)` or
any of its equivalents.

Here, `data` can be of two types. It can be a dictionary (any `Associative` subtype) which
has blocksectors `c` of type `sectortype(codomain)` as keys, and the corresponding matrix
blocks as value, i.e. `data[c]` is some `DenseMatrix` of size `(blockdim(codomain, c),
blockdim(domain, c))`. This is the form of how the data is stored within the `TensorMap`
objects.

For those space types for which a `TensorMap` can be converted to a plain multidimensional
array, the `data` can also be a general `DenseArray`, either of rank `N₁+N₂` and with
matching size `(dims(codomain)..., dims(domain)...)`, or just as a `DenseMatrix` with size
`(dim(codomain), dim(domain))`. This is true in particular if the sector type is `Trivial`,
e.g. for `CartesianSpace` or `ComplexSpace`. Then the `data` array is just reshaped into
matrix form and referred to as such in the resulting `TensorMap` instance. When `spacetype`
is `GradedSpace`, the `TensorMap` constructor will try to reconstruct the tensor data such
that the resulting tensor `t` satisfies `data == convert(Array, t)`. This might not be
possible, if the data does not respect the symmetry structure. This procedure can be
sketched using a simple physical example, namely the SWAP gate on two qubits,
```math
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{SWAP}: \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 & \to \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2\\
|i\rangle \otimes |j\rangle &\mapsto |j\rangle \otimes |i\rangle.
\end{align*}
```
This operator can be rewritten in terms of the familiar Heisenberg exchange interaction
``\vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j`` as
```math
\mathrm{SWAP} = 2 \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j + \frac{1}{2} 𝟙,
```
where ``\vec{S} = (S^x, S^y, S^z)`` and the spin-1/2 generators of SU₂ ``S^k`` are defined
defined in terms of the ``2 \times 2`` Pauli matrices ``\sigma^k`` as
``S^k = \frac{1}{2}\sigma^k``. The SWAP gate can be realized as a rank-4 `TensorMap` in the
following way:
```@repl tensors
# encode the matrix elements of the swap gate into a rank-4 array, where the first two
# indices correspond to the codomain and the last two indices correspond to the domain
data = zeros(2,2,2,2)
# the swap gate then maps the last two indices on the first two in reversed order
data[1,1,1,1] = data[2,2,2,2] = data[1,2,2,1] = data[2,1,1,2] = 1
V1 = ℂ^2 # generic qubit hilbert space
t1 = TensorMap(data, V1 ⊗ V1, V1 ⊗ V1)
V2 = SU2Space(1/2=>1) # hilbert space of an actual spin-1/2 particle, respecting symmetry
t2 = TensorMap(data, V2 ⊗ V2, V2 ⊗ V2)
V3 = U1Space(1/2=>1,-1/2=>1) # restricted space that only uses the `σ_z` rotation symmetry
t3 = TensorMap(data, V3 ⊗ V3, V3 ⊗ V3)
for (c,b) in blocks(t3)
    println("Data for block $c :")
    disp(b)
    println()
end
```
Hence, we recognize that the exchange interaction has eigenvalue ``-1`` in the coupled spin
zero sector (`SU2Irrep(0)`), and eigenvalue ``+1`` in the coupled spin 1 sector
(`SU2Irrep(1)`). Using `Irrep[U₁]` instead, we observe that both coupled charge
`U1Irrep(+1)` and `U1Irrep(-1)` have eigenvalue ``+1``. The coupled charge `U1Irrep(0)`
sector is two-dimensional, and has an eigenvalue ``+1`` and an eigenvalue ``-1``.

To construct the proper `data` in more complicated cases, one has to know where to find
each sector in the range `1:dim(V)` of every index `i` with associated space `V`, as well
as the internal structure of the representation space when the corresponding sector `c` has
`dim(c)>1`, i.e. in the case of `FusionStyle(c) isa MultipleFusion`. Currently, the only non-
abelian sectors are `Irrep[SU₂]` and `Irrep[CU₁]`, for which the internal structure is the
natural one.

There are some tools available to facilitate finding the proper range of sector `c` in space
`V`, namely `axes(V, c)`. This also works on a `ProductSpace`, with a tuple of sectors. An
example
```@repl tensors
V = SU2Space(0=>3, 1=>2, 2=>1)
P = V ⊗ V ⊗ V
axes(P, (SU2Irrep(1), SU2Irrep(0), SU2Irrep(2)))
```
Note that the length of the range is the degeneracy dimension of that sector, times the
dimension of the internal representation space, i.e. the quantum dimension of that sector.

### Assigning block data after initialization

In order to avoid having to know the internal structure of each representation space to
properly construct the full `data` array, it is often simpler to assign the block data
directly after initializing an all zero `TensorMap` with the correct spaces. While this may
seem more difficult at first sight since it requires knowing the exact entries associated to
each valid combination of domain uncoupled sectors, coupled sector and codomain uncoupled
sectors, this is often a far more natural procedure in practice.

A first option is to directly set the full matrix block for each coupled sector in the
`TensorMap`. For the example with U₁ symmetry, this can be done as
```@repl tensors
t4 = zeros(V3 ⊗ V3, V3 ⊗ V3);
block(t4, U1Irrep(0)) .= [1 0; 0 1];
block(t4, U1Irrep(1)) .= [1;;];
block(t4, U1Irrep(-1)) .= [1;;];
for (c, b) in blocks(t4)
    println("Data for block $c :")
    disp(b)
    println()
end
```
While this indeed does not require considering the internal structure of the representation
spaces, it still requires knowing the precise row and column indices corresponding to each
set of uncoupled sectors in the codmain and domain respectively to correctly assign the
nonzero entries in each block.

Perhaps the most natural way of constructing a particular `TensorMap` is to directly assign
the data slices for each splitting - fusion tree pair using the `fusiontrees(::TensorMap)`
method. This returns an iterator over all tuples `(f₁, f₂)` of splitting - fusion tree pairs
corresponding to all ways in which the set of domain uncoupled sectors can fuse to a coupled
sector and split back into the set of codomain uncoupled sectors. By directly setting the
corresponding data slice `t[f₁, f₂]` of size
`(dims(codomain(t), f₁.uncoupled)..., dims(domain(t), f₂.uncoupled)...)`, we can construct
all the block data without worrying about the internal ordering of row and column indices in
each block. In addition, the corresponding value of each fusion tree slice is often directly
informed by the object we are trying to construct in the first place. For example, in order
to construct the Heisenberg exchange interaction on two spin-1/2 particles ``i`` and ``j``
as an SU₂ symmetric `TensorMap`, we can make use of the observation that
```math
\vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left( \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j \right)^2 - \vec{S}_i^2 - \vec{S}_j^2 \right).
```
Recalling some basic group theory, we know that the
[quadratic Casimir of SU₂](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_SU(2)#The_Casimir_element),
``\vec{S}^2``, has a well-defined eigenvalue ``j(j+1)`` on every irrep of spin ``j``. From
the above expressions, we can therefore directly read off the eigenvalues of the SWAP gate
in terms of this Casimir eigenvalue on the domain uncoupled sectors and the coupled sector.
This gives us exactly the prescription we need to assign the data slice corresponding to
each splitting - fusion tree pair:
```@repl tensors
C(s::SU2Irrep) = s.j * (s.j + 1)
t5 = zeros(V2 ⊗ V2, V2 ⊗ V2);
for (f₁, f₂) in fusiontrees(t5)
    t5[f₁, f₂] .= C(f₂.coupled) - C(f₂.uncoupled[1]) - C(f₂.uncoupled[2]) + 1/2
end
for (c, b) in blocks(t5)
    println("Data for block $c :")
    disp(b)
    println()
end
```

### Constructing similar tensors

A third way to construct a `TensorMap` instance is to use `Base.similar`, i.e.

```julia
similar(t [, T::Type{<:Number}, codomain, domain])
```

where `T` is a possibly different `eltype` for the tensor data, and `codomain` and `domain`
optionally define a new codomain and domain for the resulting tensor. By default, these
values just take the value from the input tensor `t`. The result will be a new `TensorMap`
instance, with `undef` data, but whose data is stored in the same subtype of `DenseMatrix`
(e.g. `Matrix` or `CuMatrix` or ...) as `t`. In particular, this uses the methods
`storagetype(t)` and `TensorKit.similarstoragetype(t, T)`.

### Special purpose constructors

Finally, there are methods `zero`, `one`, `id`, `isomorphism`, `unitary` and `isometry` to
create specific new tensors. Tensor maps behave as vectors and can be added (if they have
the same domain and codomain); `zero(t)` is the additive identity, i.e. a `TensorMap`
instance where all entries are zero. For a `t::TensorMap` with `domain(t) == codomain(t)`,
i.e. an endomorphism, `one(t)` creates the identity tensor, i.e. the identity under
composition. As discussed in the section on [linear algebra operations](@ref
ss_tensor_linalg), we denote composition of tensor maps with the mutliplication operator
`*`, such that `one(t)` is the multiplicative identity. Similarly, it can be created as
`id(V)` with `V` the relevant vector space, e.g. `one(t) == id(domain(t))`. The identity
tensor is currently represented with dense data, and one can use `id(A::Type{<:DenseMatrix},
V)` to specify the type of `DenseMatrix` (and its `eltype`), e.g. `A = Matrix{Float64}`.
Finally, it often occurs that we want to construct a specific isomorphism between two spaces
that are isomorphic but not equal, and for which there is no canonical choice. Hereto, one
can use the method `u = isomorphism([A::Type{<:DenseMatrix}, ] codomain, domain)`, which
will explicitly check that the domain and codomain are isomorphic, and return an error
otherwise. Again, an optional first argument can be given to specify the specific type of
`DenseMatrix` that is currently used to store the rather trivial data of this tensor. If
`InnerProductStyle(u) <: EuclideanProduct`, the same result can be obtained with the method
`u = unitary([A::Type{<:DenseMatrix}, ] codomain, domain)`. Note that reversing the domain
and codomain yields the inverse morphism, which in the case of `EuclideanProduct` coincides
with the adjoint morphism, i.e. `isomorphism(A, domain, codomain) == adjoint(u) == inv(u)`,
where `inv` and `adjoint` will be further discussed [below](@ref ss_tensor_linalg).
Finally, if two spaces `V1` and `V2` are such that `V2` can be embedded in `V1`, i.e. there
exists an inclusion with a left inverse, and furthermore they represent tensor products of
some `ElementarySpace` with `EuclideanProduct`, the function
`w = isometry([A::Type{<:DenseMatrix}, ], V1, V2)` creates one specific isometric
embedding, such that `adjoint(w) * w == id(V2)` and `w * adjoint(w)` is some hermitian
idempotent (a.k.a. orthogonal projector) acting on `V1`. An error will be thrown if such a
map cannot be constructed for the given domain and codomain.

Let's conclude this section with some examples with `GradedSpace`.
```@repl tensors
V1 = ℤ₂Space(0=>3,1=>2)
V2 = ℤ₂Space(0=>2,1=>1)
# First a `TensorMap{ℤ₂Space, 1, 1}`
m = randn(V1, V2)
convert(Array, m) |> disp
# compare with:
block(m, Irrep[ℤ₂](0)) |> disp
block(m, Irrep[ℤ₂](1)) |> disp
# Now a `TensorMap{ℤ₂Space, 2, 2}`
t = randn(V1 ⊗ V1, V2 ⊗ V2')
(array = convert(Array, t)) |> disp
d1 = dim(codomain(t))
d2 = dim(domain(t))
(matrix = reshape(array, d1, d2)) |> disp
(u = reshape(convert(Array, unitary(codomain(t), fuse(codomain(t)))), d1, d1)) |> disp
(v = reshape(convert(Array, unitary(domain(t), fuse(domain(t)))), d2, d2)) |> disp
u'*u ≈ I ≈ v'*v
(u'*matrix*v) |> disp
# compare with:
block(t, Z2Irrep(0)) |> disp
block(t, Z2Irrep(1)) |> disp
```
Here, we illustrated some additional concepts. Firstly, note that we convert a `TensorMap`
to an `Array`. This only works when `sectortype(t)` supports `fusiontensor`, and in
particular when `BraidingStyle(sectortype(t)) == Bosonic()`, e.g. the case of trivial
tensors (the category ``\mathbf{Vect}``) and group representations (the category
``\mathbf{Rep}_{\mathsf{G}}``, which can be interpreted as a subcategory of
``\mathbf{Vect}``). Here, we are in this case with ``\mathsf{G} = ℤ₂``. For a
`TensorMap{S,1,1}`, the blocks directly correspond to the diagonal blocks in the block
diagonal structure of its representation as an `Array`, there is no basis transform in
between. This is no longer the case for `TensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}` with different values of `N₁`
and `N₂`. Here, we use the operation `fuse(V)`, which creates an `ElementarySpace` which is
isomorphic to a given space `V` (of type `ProductSpace` or `ElementarySpace`). The specific
map between those two spaces constructed using the specific method `unitary` implements
precisely the basis change from the product basis to the coupled basis. In this case, for a
group `G` with `FusionStyle(Irrep[G]) isa UniqueFusion`, it is a permutation matrix. Specifically
choosing `V` equal to the codomain and domain of `t`, we can construct the explicit basis
transforms that bring `t` into block diagonal form.

Let's repeat the same exercise for `I = Irrep[SU₂]`, which has `FusionStyle(I) isa MultipleFusion`.
```@repl tensors
V1 = SU₂Space(0=>2,1=>1)
V2 = SU₂Space(0=>1,1=>1)
# First a `TensorMap{SU₂Space, 1, 1}`
m = randn(V1, V2)
convert(Array, m) |> disp
# compare with:
block(m, Irrep[SU₂](0)) |> disp
block(m, Irrep[SU₂](1)) |> disp
# Now a `TensorMap{SU₂Space, 2, 2}`
t = randn(V1 ⊗ V1, V2 ⊗ V2')
(array = convert(Array, t)) |> disp
d1 = dim(codomain(t))
d2 = dim(domain(t))
(matrix = reshape(array, d1, d2)) |> disp
(u = reshape(convert(Array, unitary(codomain(t), fuse(codomain(t)))), d1, d1)) |> disp
(v = reshape(convert(Array, unitary(domain(t), fuse(domain(t)))), d2, d2)) |> disp
u'*u ≈ I ≈ v'*v
(u'*matrix*v) |> disp
# compare with:
block(t, SU2Irrep(0)) |> disp
block(t, SU2Irrep(1)) |> disp
block(t, SU2Irrep(2)) |> disp
```
Note that the basis transforms `u` and `v` are no longer permutation matrices, but are
still unitary. Furthermore, note that they render the tensor block diagonal, but that now
every element of the diagonal blocks labeled by `c` comes itself in a tensor product with
an identity matrix of size `dim(c)`, i.e. `dim(SU2Irrep(1)) = 3` and
`dim(SU2Irrep(2)) = 5`.

## [Tensor properties](@id ss_tensor_properties)

Given a `t::AbstractTensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}`, there are various methods to query its properties.
The most important are clearly `codomain(t)` and `domain(t)`. For `t::AbstractTensor{S,N}`,
i.e. `t::AbstractTensorMap{S,N,0}`, we can use `space(t)` as synonym for `codomain(t)`.
However, for a general `AbstractTensorMap` this has no meaning. However, we can query
`space(t, i)`, the space associated with the `i`th index. For `i ∈ 1:N₁`, this corresponds
to `codomain(t, i) = codomain(t)[i]`. For `j = i-N₁ ∈ (1:N₂)`, this corresponds to
`dual(domain(t, j)) = dual(domain(t)[j])`.

The total number of indices, i.e. `N₁+N₂`, is given by `numind(t)`, with `N₁ == numout(t)`
and `N₂ == numin(t)`, the number of outgoing and incoming indices. There are also the
unexported methods `TensorKit.codomainind(t)` and `TensorKit.domainind(t)` which return the
tuples `(1, 2, …, N₁)` and `(N₁+1, …, N₁+N₂)`, and are useful for internal purposes. The
type parameter `S<:ElementarySpace` can be obtained as `spacetype(t)`; the corresponding
sector can directly obtained as `sectortype(t)` and is `Trivial` when
`S != GradedSpace`. The underlying field scalars of `S` can also directly be obtained as
`field(t)`. This is different from `eltype(t)`, which returns the type of `Number` in the
tensor data, i.e. the type parameter `T` in the (subtype of) `DenseMatrix{T}` in which the
matrix blocks are stored. Note that during construction, a (one-time) warning is printed if
`!(T ⊂ field(S))`. The specific `DenseMatrix{T}` subtype in which the tensor data is stored
is obtained as `storagetype(t)`. Each of the methods `numind`, `numout`, `numin`,
`TensorKit.codomainind`, `TensorKit.domainind`, `spacetype`, `sectortype`, `field`, `eltype`
and `storagetype` work in the type domain as well, i.e. they are encoded in `typeof(t)`.

Finally, there are methods to probe the data, which we already encountered.
`blocksectors(t)` returns an iterator over the different coupled sectors that can be
obtained from fusing the uncoupled sectors available in the domain, but they must also be
obtained from fusing the uncoupled sectors available in the codomain (i.e. it is the
intersection of both `blocksectors(codomain(t))` and `blocksectors(domain(t))`). For a
specific sector `c ∈ blocksectors(t)`, `block(t, c)` returns the corresponding data. Both
are obtained together with `blocks(t)`, which returns an iterator over the pairs
`c=>block(t, c)`. Furthermore, there is `fusiontrees(t)` which returns an iterator over
splitting-fusion tree pairs `(f₁,f₂)`, for which the corresponding data is given by
`t[f₁,f₂]` (i.e. using Base.getindex).

Let's again illustrate these methods with an example, continuing with the tensor `t` from
the previous example
```@repl tensors
typeof(t)
codomain(t)
domain(t)
space(t,1)
space(t,2)
space(t,3)
space(t,4)
numind(t)
numout(t)
numin(t)
spacetype(t)
sectortype(t)
field(t)
eltype(t)
storagetype(t)
blocksectors(t)
blocks(t)
block(t, first(blocksectors(t)))
fusiontrees(t)
f1, f2 = first(fusiontrees(t))
t[f1,f2]
```

## [Reading and writing tensors: `Dict` conversion](@id ss_tensor_readwrite)

There are no custom or dedicated methods for reading, writing or storing `TensorMaps`,
however, there is the possibility to convert a `t::AbstractTensorMap` into a `Dict`, simply
as `convert(Dict, t)`. The backward conversion `convert(TensorMap, dict)` will return a
tensor that is equal to `t`, i.e. `t == convert(TensorMap, convert(Dict, t))`.

This conversion relies on that the string represenation of objects such as `VectorSpace`,
`FusionTree` or `Sector` should be such that it represents valid code to recreate the
object. Hence, we store information about the domain and codomain of the tensor, and the
sector associated with each data block, as a `String` obtained with `repr`. This provides
the flexibility to still change the internal structure of such objects, without this
breaking the ability to load older data files. The resulting dictionary can then be stored
using any of the provided Julia packages such as
[JLD.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JLD.jl),
[JLD2.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JLD2.jl),
[BSON.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/BSON.jl),
[JSON.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JSON.jl), ...

## [Vector space and linear algebra operations](@id ss_tensor_linalg)

`AbstractTensorMap` instances `t` represent linear maps, i.e. homomorphisms in a `𝕜`-linear
category, just like matrices. To a large extent, they follow the interface of `Matrix` in
Julia's `LinearAlgebra` standard library. Many methods from `LinearAlgebra` are (re)exported
by TensorKit.jl, and can then us be used without `using LinearAlgebra` explicitly. In all
of the following methods, the implementation acts directly on the underlying matrix blocks
(typically using the same method) and never needs to perform any basis transforms.

In particular, `AbstractTensorMap` instances can be composed, provided the domain of the
first object coincides with the codomain of the second. Composing tensor maps uses the
regular multiplication symbol as in `t = t1*t2`, which is also used for matrix
multiplication. TensorKit.jl also supports (and exports) the mutating method
`mul!(t, t1, t2)`. We can then also try to invert a tensor map using `inv(t)`, though this
can only exist if the domain and codomain are isomorphic, which can e.g. be checked as
`fuse(codomain(t)) == fuse(domain(t))`. If the inverse is composed with another tensor
`t2`, we can use the syntax `t1\t2` or `t2/t1`. However, this syntax also accepts instances
`t1` whose domain and codomain are not isomorphic, and then amounts to `pinv(t1)`, the
Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This, however, is only really justified as minimizing the
least squares problem if `InnerProductStyle(t) <: EuclideanProduct`.

`AbstractTensorMap` instances behave themselves as vectors (i.e. they are `𝕜`-linear) and
so they can be multiplied by scalars and, if they live in the same space, i.e. have the same
domain and codomain, they can be added to each other. There is also a `zero(t)`, the
additive identity, which produces a zero tensor with the same domain and codomain as `t`. In
addition, `TensorMap` supports basic Julia methods such as `fill!` and `copy!`, as well
as `copy(t)` to create a copy with independent data. Aside from basic `+` and `*`
operations, TensorKit.jl reexports a number of efficient in-place methods from
`LinearAlgebra`, such as `axpy!` (for `y ← α * x + y`), `axpby!` (for `y ← α * x + β * y`),
`lmul!` and `rmul!` (for `y ← α*y` and `y ← y*α`, which is typically the same) and `mul!`,
which can also be used for out-of-place scalar multiplication `y ← α*x`.

For `t::AbstractTensorMap{S}` where `InnerProductStyle(S) <: EuclideanProduct`, we can
compute `norm(t)`, and for two such instances, the inner product `dot(t1, t2)`, provided
`t1` and `t2` have the same domain and codomain. Furthermore, there is `normalize(t)` and
`normalize!(t)` to return a scaled version of `t` with unit norm. These operations should
also exist for  `InnerProductStyle(S) <: HasInnerProduct`, but require an interface for
defining a custom inner product in these spaces. Currently, there is no concrete subtype of
`HasInnerProduct` that is not an `EuclideanProduct`. In particular, `CartesianSpace`,
`ComplexSpace` and `GradedSpace` all have `InnerProductStyle(V) <: EuclideanProduct`.

With tensors that have `InnerProductStyle(t) <: EuclideanProduct` there is associated an
adjoint operation, given by `adjoint(t)` or simply `t'`, such that
`domain(t') == codomain(t)` and `codomain(t') == domain(t)`. Note that for an instance
`t::TensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}`, `t'` is simply stored in a wrapper called
`AdjointTensorMap{S,N₂,N₁}`, which is another subtype of `AbstractTensorMap`. This should
be mostly unvisible to the user, as all methods should work for this type as well. It can
be hard to reason about the index order of `t'`, i.e. index `i` of `t` appears in `t'` at
index position `j = TensorKit.adjointtensorindex(t, i)`, where the latter method is
typically not necessary and hence unexported. There is also a plural
`TensorKit.adjointtensorindices` to convert multiple indices at once. Note that, because
the adjoint interchanges domain and codomain, we have `space(t', j) == space(t, i)'`.

`AbstractTensorMap` instances can furthermore be tested for exact (`t1 == t2`) or
approximate (`t1 ≈ t2`) equality, though the latter requires that `norm` can be computed.

When tensor map instances are endomorphisms, i.e. they have the same domain and codomain,
there is a multiplicative identity which can be obtained as `one(t)` or `one!(t)`, where the
latter overwrites the contents of `t`. The multiplicative identity on a space `V` can also
be obtained using `id(A, V)` as discussed [above](@ref ss_tensor_construction), such that
for a general homomorphism `t′`, we have `t′ == id(codomain(t′))*t′ == t′*id(domain(t′))`.
Returning to the case of endomorphisms `t`, we can compute the trace via `tr(t)` and
exponentiate them using `exp(t)`, or if the contents of `t` can be destroyed in the
process, `exp!(t)`. Furthermore, there are a number of tensor factorizations for both
endomorphisms and general homomorphism that we discuss below.

Finally, there are a number of operations that also belong in this paragraph because of
their analogy to common matrix operations. The tensor product of two `TensorMap` instances
`t1` and `t2` is obtained as `t1 ⊗ t2` and results in a new `TensorMap` with
`codomain(t1⊗t2) = codomain(t1) ⊗ codomain(t2)` and
`domain(t1⊗t2) = domain(t1) ⊗ domain(t2)`. If we have two `TensorMap{S,N,1}` instances `t1`
and `t2` with the same codomain, we can combine them in a way that is analoguous to `hcat`,
i.e. we stack them such that the new tensor `catdomain(t1, t2)` has also the same codomain,
but has a domain which is `domain(t1) ⊕ domain(t2)`. Similarly, if `t1` and `t2` are of
type `TensorMap{S,1,N}` and have the same domain, the operation `catcodomain(t1, t2)`
results in a new tensor with the same domain and a codomain given by
`codomain(t1) ⊕ codomain(t2)`, which is the analogy of `vcat`. Note that direct sum only
makes sense between `ElementarySpace` objects, i.e. there is no way to give a tensor
product meaning to a direct sum of tensor product spaces.

Time for some more examples:
```@repl tensors
t == t + zero(t) == t*id(domain(t)) == id(codomain(t))*t
t2 = randn(ComplexF64, codomain(t), domain(t));
dot(t2, t)
tr(t2'*t)
dot(t2, t) ≈ dot(t', t2')
dot(t2, t2)
norm(t2)^2
t3 = copy!(similar(t, ComplexF64), t);
t3 == t
rmul!(t3, 0.8);
t3 ≈ 0.8*t
axpby!(0.5, t2, 1.3im, t3);
t3 ≈ 0.5 * t2  +  0.8 * 1.3im * t
t4 = randn(fuse(codomain(t)), codomain(t));
t5 = TensorMap(undef, fuse(codomain(t)), domain(t));
mul!(t5, t4, t) == t4*t
inv(t4) * t4 ≈ id(codomain(t))
t4 * inv(t4) ≈ id(fuse(codomain(t)))
t4 \ (t4 * t) ≈ t
t6 = randn(ComplexF64, V1, codomain(t));
numout(t4) == numout(t6) == 1
t7 = catcodomain(t4, t6);
foreach(println, (codomain(t4), codomain(t6), codomain(t7)))
norm(t7) ≈ sqrt(norm(t4)^2 + norm(t6)^2)
t8 = t4 ⊗ t6;
foreach(println, (codomain(t4), codomain(t6), codomain(t8)))
foreach(println, (domain(t4), domain(t6), domain(t8)))
norm(t8) ≈ norm(t4)*norm(t6)
```

## Index manipulations

In many cases, the bipartition of tensor indices (i.e. `ElementarySpace` instances) between
the codomain and domain is not fixed throughout the different operations that need to be
performed on that tensor map, i.e. we want to use the duality to move spaces from domain to
codomain and vice versa. Furthermore, we want to use the braiding to reshuffle the order of
the indices.

For this, we use an interface that is closely related to that for manipulating splitting-
fusion tree pairs, namely [`braid`](@ref) and [`permute`](@ref), with the interface

```julia
braid(t::AbstractTensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}, levels::NTuple{N₁+N₂,Int},
        p1::NTuple{N₁′,Int}, p2::NTuple{N₂′,Int})
```

and

```julia
permute(t::AbstractTensorMap{S,N₁,N₂},
        p1::NTuple{N₁′,Int}, p2::NTuple{N₂′,Int}; copy = false)
```

both of which return an instance of `AbstractTensorMap{S,N₁′,N₂′}`.

In these methods, `p1` and `p2` specify which of the original tensor indices ranging from
`1` to `N₁+N₂` make up the new codomain (with `N₁′` spaces) and new domain (with `N₂′`
spaces). Hence, `(p1..., p2...)` should be a valid permutation of `1:(N₁+N₂)`. Note that,
throughout TensorKit.jl, permutations are always specified using tuples of `Int`s, for
reasons of type stability. For `braid`, we also need to specify `levels` or depths for each
of the indices of the original tensor, which determine whether indices will braid over or
underneath each other (use the braiding or its inverse). We refer to the section on
[manipulating fusion trees](@ref ss_fusiontrees) for more details.

When `BraidingStyle(sectortype(t)) isa SymmetricBraiding`, we can use the simpler interface
of `permute`, which does not require the argument `levels`. `permute` accepts a keyword
argument `copy`. When `copy == true`, the result will be a tensor with newly allocated data
that can independently be modified from that of the input tensor `t`. When `copy` takes the
default value `false`, `permute` can try to return the result in a way that it shares its
data with the input tensor `t`, though this is only possible in specific cases (e.g. when
`sectortype(S) == Trivial` and `(p1..., p2...) = (1:(N₁+N₂)...)`).

Both `braid` and `permute` come in a version where the result is stored in an already
existing tensor, i.e. [`braid!(tdst, tsrc, levels, p1, p2)`](@ref) and
[`permute!(tdst, tsrc, p1, p2)`](@ref).

Another operation that belongs und index manipulations is taking the `transpose` of a
tensor, i.e. `LinearAlgebra.transpose(t)` and `LinearAlgebra.transpose!(tdst, tsrc)`, both
of which are reexported by TensorKit.jl. Note that `transpose(t)` is not simply equal to
reshuffling domain and codomain with
`braid(t, (1:(N₁+N₂)...), reverse(domainind(tsrc)), reverse(codomainind(tsrc))))`. Indeed,
the graphical representation (where we draw the codomain and domain as a single object),
makes clear that this introduces an additional (inverse) twist, which is then compensated
in the `transpose` implementation.

```@raw html
<img src="../img/tensor-transpose.svg" alt="transpose" class="color-invertible"/>
```

In categorical language, the reason for this extra twist is that we use the left
coevaluation ``η``, but the right evaluation ``\tilde{ϵ}``, when repartitioning the indices
between domain and codomain.

There are a number of other index related manipulations. We can apply a twist (or inverse
twist) to one of the tensor map indices via [`twist(t, i; inv = false)`](@ref) or
[`twist!(t, i; inv = false)`](@ref). Note that the latter method does not store the result
in a new destination tensor, but just modifies the tensor `t` in place. Twisting several
indices simultaneously can be obtained by using the defining property

``θ_{V⊗W} = τ_{W,V} ∘ (θ_W ⊗ θ_V) ∘ τ_{V,W} = (θ_V ⊗ θ_W) ∘ τ_{W,V} ∘ τ_{V,W}.``

but is currently not implemented explicitly.

For all sector types `I` with `BraidingStyle(I) == Bosonic()`, all twists are `1` and thus
have no effect. Let us start with some examples, in which we illustrate that, albeit
`permute` might act highly non-trivial on the fusion trees and on the corresponding data,
after conversion to a regular `Array` (when possible), it just acts like `permutedims`
```@repl tensors
domain(t) → codomain(t)
ta = convert(Array, t);
t′ = permute(t, (1,2,3,4));
domain(t′) → codomain(t′)
convert(Array, t′) ≈ ta
t′′ = permute(t, (4,2,3),(1,));
domain(t′′) → codomain(t′′)
convert(Array, t′′) ≈ permutedims(ta, (4,2,3,1))
m
transpose(m)
convert(Array, transpose(t)) ≈ permutedims(ta,(4,3,2,1))
dot(t2, t) ≈ dot(transpose(t2), transpose(t))
transpose(transpose(t)) ≈ t
twist(t, 3) ≈ t
# as twist acts trivially for
BraidingStyle(sectortype(t))
```
Note that `transpose` acts like one would expect on a `TensorMap{S,1,1}`. On a
`TensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}`, because `transpose` replaces the codomain with the dual of the
domain, which has its tensor product operation reversed, this in the end amounts in a
complete reversal of all tensor indices when representing it as a plain mutli-dimensional
`Array`. Also, note that we have not defined the conjugation of `TensorMap` instances. One
definition that one could think of is `conj(t) = adjoint(transpose(t))`. However note that
`codomain(adjoint(tranpose(t))) == domain(transpose(t)) == dual(codomain(t))` and similarly
`domain(adjoint(tranpose(t))) == dual(domain(t))`, where `dual` of a `ProductSpace` is
composed of the dual of the `ElementarySpace` instances, in reverse order of tensor
product. This might be very confusing, and as such we leave tensor conjugation undefined.
However, note that we have a conjugation syntax within the context of
[tensor contractions](@ref ss_tensor_contraction).

To show the effect of `twist`, we now consider a type of sector `I` for which
`BraidingStyle{I} != Bosonic()`. In particular, we use `FibonacciAnyon`. We cannot convert
the resulting `TensorMap` to an `Array`, so we have to rely on indirect tests to verify our
results.

```@repl tensors
V1 = GradedSpace{FibonacciAnyon}(:I=>3,:τ=>2)
V2 = GradedSpace{FibonacciAnyon}(:I=>2,:τ=>1)

twist(braid(m, (1,2), (2,), (1,)), 1)
t1 = randn(V1*V2', V2*V1);
t2 = randn(ComplexF64, V1*V2', V2*V1);
dot(t1, t2) ≈ dot(transpose(t1), transpose(t2))
transpose(transpose(t1)) ≈ t1
```

A final operation that one might expect in this section is to fuse or join indices, and its
inverse, to split a given index into two or more indices. For a plain tensor (i.e. with
`sectortype(t) == Trivial`) amount to the equivalent of `reshape` on the multidimensional
data. However, this represents only one possibility, as there is no canonically unique way
to embed the tensor product of two spaces `V₁ ⊗ V₂` in a new space `V = fuse(V₁⊗V₂)`. Such a
mapping can always be accompagnied by a basis transform. However, one particular choice is
created by the function `isomorphism`, or for `EuclideanProduct` spaces, `unitary`.
Hence, we can join or fuse two indices of a tensor by first constructing
`u = unitary(fuse(space(t, i) ⊗ space(t, j)), space(t, i) ⊗ space(t, j))` and then
contracting this map with indices `i` and `j` of `t`, as explained in the section on
[contracting tensors](@ref ss_tensor_contraction). Note, however, that a typical algorithm
is not expected to often need to fuse and split indices, as e.g. tensor factorizations can
easily be applied without needing to `reshape` or fuse indices first, as explained in the
next section.

## [Tensor factorizations](@id ss_tensor_factorization)

### Eigenvalue decomposition
As tensors are linear maps, they have various kinds of factorizations. Endomorphism, i.e.
tensor maps `t` with `codomain(t) == domain(t)`, have an eigenvalue decomposition. For
this, we overload both `LinearAlgebra.eigen(t; kwargs...)` and
`LinearAlgebra.eigen!(t; kwargs...)`, where the latter destroys `t` in the process. The
keyword arguments are the same that are accepted by `LinearAlgebra.eigen(!)` for matrices.
The result is returned as `D, V = eigen(t)`, such that `t*V ≈ V*D`. For given
`t::TensorMap{S,N,N}`, `V` is a `TensorMap{S,N,1}`, whose codomain corresponds to that of
`t`, but whose domain is a single space `S` (or more correctly a `ProductSpace{S,1}`), that
corresponds to `fuse(codomain(t))`. The eigenvalues are encoded in `D`, a
`TensorMap{S,1,1}`, whose domain and codomain correspond to the domain of `V`. Indeed, we
cannot reasonably associate a tensor product structure with the different eigenvalues. Note
that `D` stores the eigenvalues on the diagonal of a (collection of) `DenseMatrix`
instance(s), as there is currently no dedicated `DiagonalTensorMap` or diagonal storage
support.

We also define `LinearAlgebra.ishermitian(t)`, which can only return true for instances of
`AbstractEuclideanTensorMap`. In all other cases, as the inner product is not defined, there
is no notion of hermiticity (i.e. we are not working in a `†`-category). For instances of
`EuclideanTensorMap`, we also define and export the routines `eigh` and `eigh!`, which
compute the eigenvalue decomposition under the guarantee (not checked) that the map is
hermitian. Hence, eigenvalues will be real and `V` will be unitary with
`eltype(V) == eltype(t)`. We also define and export `eig` and `eig!`, which similarly assume
that the `TensorMap` is not hermitian (hence this does not require `EuclideanTensorMap`),
and always returns complex values eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Like for matrices,
`LinearAlgebra.eigen` is type unstable and checks hermiticity at run-time, then falling back
to either `eig` or `eigh`.

### Orthogonal factorizations

Other factorizations that are provided by TensorKit.jl are orthogonal or unitary in nature,
and thus always require a `AbstractEuclideanTensorMap`. However, they don't require equal
domain and codomain. Let us first discuss the *singular value decomposition*, for which we
define and export the methods [`tsvd`](@ref) and `tsvd!` (where as always, the latter
destroys the input).

```julia
U, Σ, Vʰ, ϵ = tsvd(t; trunc = notrunc(), p::Real = 2,
                        alg::OrthogonalFactorizationAlgorithm = SDD())
```

This computes a (possibly truncated) singular value decomposition of
`t::TensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}` (with `InnerProductStyle(t)<:EuclideanProduct`), such that
`norm(t - U*Σ*Vʰ) ≈ ϵ`, where `U::TensorMap{S,N₁,1}`, `S::TensorMap{S,1,1}`,
`Vʰ::TensorMap{S,1,N₂}` and `ϵ::Real`. `U` is an isometry, i.e. `U'*U` approximates the
identity, whereas `U*U'` is an idempotent (squares to itself). The same holds for
`adjoint(Vʰ)`. The domain of `U` equals the domain and codomain of `Σ` and the codomain of
`Vʰ`. In the case of `trunc = notrunc()` (default value, see below), this space is
given by `min(fuse(codomain(t)), fuse(domain(t)))`. The singular values are contained in `Σ`
and are stored on the diagonal of a (collection of) `DenseMatrix` instance(s), similar to
the eigenvalues before.

The keyword argument `trunc` provides a way to control the truncation, and is connected to 
the keyword argument `p`. The default value `notrunc()` implies no truncation, and thus
`ϵ = 0`. Other valid options are

*   `truncerr(η::Real)`: truncates such that the `p`-norm of the truncated singular values
    is smaller than `η` times the `p`-norm of all singular values;

*   `truncdim(χ::Integer)`: finds the optimal truncation such that the equivalent total
    dimension of the internal vector space is no larger than `χ`;

*   `truncspace(W)`: truncates such that the dimension of the internal vector space is
    smaller than that of `W` in any sector, i.e. with
    `W₀ = min(fuse(codomain(t)), fuse(domain(t)))` this option will result in
    `domain(U) == domain(Σ) == codomain(Σ) == codomain(Vᵈ) == min(W, W₀)`;

*   `trunbelow(η::Real)`: truncates such that every singular value is larger then `η`; this
    is different from `truncerr(η)` with `p = Inf` because it works in absolute rather than
    relative values.

Furthermore, the `alg` keyword can be either `SVD()` or `SDD()` (default), which
corresponds to two different algorithms in LAPACK to compute singular value decompositions.
The default value `SDD()` uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm and is typically the
fastest, but can loose some accuracy. The `SVD()` method uses a QR-iteration scheme and can
be more accurate, but is typically slower. Since Julia 1.3, these two algorithms are also
available in the `LinearAlgebra` standard library, where they are specified as
`LinearAlgebra.DivideAndConquer()` and `LinearAlgebra.QRIteration()`.

Note that we defined the new method `tsvd` (truncated or tensor singular value
decomposition), rather than overloading `LinearAlgebra.svd`. We (will) also support
`LinearAlgebra.svd(t)` as alternative for `tsvd(t; trunc = notrunc())`, but note that
the return values are then given by `U, Σ, V = svd(t)` with `V = adjoint(Vʰ)`.

We also define the following pair of orthogonal factorization algorithms, which are useful
when one is not interested in truncating a tensor or knowing the singular values, but only
in its image or coimage.

*   `Q, R = leftorth(t; alg::OrthogonalFactorizationAlgorithm = QRpos(), kwargs...)`:
    this produces an isometry `Q::TensorMap{S,N₁,1}` (i.e. `Q'*Q` approximates the identity,
    `Q*Q'` is an idempotent, i.e. squares to itself) and a general tensor map
    `R::TensorMap{1,N₂}`, such that `t ≈ Q*R`. Here, the domain of `Q` and thus codomain of
    `R` is a single vector space of type `S` that is typically given by
    `min(fuse(codomain(t)), fuse(domain(t)))`.

    The underlying algorithm used to compute this decomposition can be chosen among `QR()`,
    `QRpos()`, `QL()`, `QLpos()`, `SVD()`, `SDD()`, `Polar()`. `QR()` uses the underlying
    `qr` decomposition from `LinearAlgebra`, while `QRpos()` (the default) adds a correction
    to that to make sure that the diagonal elements of `R` are positive.
    Both result in upper triangular `R`, which are square when `codomain(t) ≾ domain(t)`
    and wide otherwise. `QL()` and `QLpos()` similarly result in a lower triangular
    matrices in `R`, but only work in the former case, i.e. `codomain(t) ≾ domain(t)`,
    which amounts to `blockdim(codomain(t), c) >= blockdim(domain(t), c)` for all
    `c ∈ blocksectors(t)`.

    One can also use `alg = SVD()` or `alg = SDD()`, with extra keywords to control the
    absolute (`atol`) or relative (`rtol`) tolerance. We then set `Q=U` and `R=Σ*Vʰ` from
    the corresponding singular value decomposition, where only these singular values
    `σ >= max(atol, norm(t)*rtol)` (and corresponding singular vectors in `U`) are kept.
    More finegrained control on the chosen singular values can be obtained with `tsvd` and
    its `trunc` keyword.

    Finally, `Polar()` sets `Q=U*Vʰ` and `R = (Vʰ)'*Σ*Vʰ`, such that `R` is positive
    definite; in this case `SDD()` is used to actually compute the singular value
    decomposition and no `atol` or `rtol` can be provided.

*   `L, Q = rightorth(t; alg::OrthogonalFactorizationAlgorithm = QRpos())`:
    this produces a general tensor map `L::TensorMap{S,N₁,1}` and the adjoint of an isometry
    `Q::TensorMap{S,1,N₂}`, such that `t ≈ L*Q`. Here, the domain of `L` and thus codomain
    of `Q` is a single vector space of type `S` that is typically given by
    `min(fuse(codomain(t)), fuse(domain(t)))`.

    The underlying algorithm used to compute this decomposition can be chosen among `LQ()`,
    `LQpos()`, `RQ()`, `RQpos()`, `SVD()`, `SDD()`, `Polar()`. `LQ()` uses the underlying
    `qr` decomposition from `LinearAlgebra` on the transposed data, and leads to lower
    triangular matrices in `L`; `LQpos()` makes sure the diagonal elements are
    positive. The matrices `L` are square when `codomain(t) ≿ domain(t)` and tall otherwise.
    Similarly, `RQ()` and `RQpos()` result in upper triangular matrices in `L`, but only
    works if `codomain(t) ≿ domain(t)`, i.e. when
    `blockdim(codomain(t), c) <= blockdim(domain(t), c)` for all `c ∈ blocksectors(t)`.

    One can also use `alg = SVD()` or `alg = SDD()`, with extra keywords to control the
    absolute (`atol`) or relative (`rtol`) tolerance. We then set `L=U*Σ` and `Q=Vʰ` from
    the corresponding singular value decomposition, where only these singular values
    `σ >= max(atol, norm(t)*rtol)` (and corresponding singular vectors in `Vʰ`) are kept.
    More finegrained control on the chosen singular values can be obtained with `tsvd` and
    its `trunc` keyword.

    Finally, `Polar()` sets `L = U*Σ*U'` and `Q=U*Vʰ`, such that `L` is positive definite;
    in this case `SDD()` is used to actually compute the singular value decomposition and no
    `atol` or `rtol` can be provided.

Furthermore, we can compute an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of the image
and of the co-image (i.e. the kernel) with the following methods:

*   `N = leftnull(t; alg::OrthogonalFactorizationAlgorithm = QR(), kwargs...)`:
    returns an isometric `TensorMap{S,N₁,1}` (i.e. `N'*N` approximates the identity) such
    that `N'*t` is approximately zero.

    Here, `alg` can be `QR()` (`QRpos()` acts identically in this case), which assumes that
    `t` is full rank in all of its blocks and only returns an orthonormal basis for the
    missing columns.

    If this is not the case, one can also use `alg = SVD()` or `alg = SDD()`, with extra
    keywords to control the absolute (`atol`) or relative (`rtol`) tolerance. We then
    construct `N` from the left singular vectors corresponding to singular values
    `σ < max(atol, norm(t)*rtol)`.

*   `N = rightnull(t; alg::OrthogonalFactorizationAlgorithm = QR(), kwargs...)`:
    returns a `TensorMap{S,1,N₂}` with isometric adjoint (i.e. `N*N'` approximates the
    identity) such that `t*N'` is approximately zero.

    Here, `alg` can be `LQ()` (`LQpos()` acts identically in this case), which assumes that
    `t` is full rank in all of its blocks and only returns an orthonormal basis for the
    missing rows.

    If this is not the case, one can also use `alg = SVD()` or `alg = SDD()`, with extra
    keywords to control the absolute (`atol`) or relative (`rtol`) tolerance. We then
    construct `N` from the right singular vectors corresponding to singular values
    `σ < max(atol, norm(t)*rtol)`.

Note that the methods `leftorth`, `rightorth`, `leftnull` and `rightnull` also come in a
form with exclamation mark, i.e. `leftorth!`, `rightorth!`, `leftnull!` and `rightnull!`,
which destroy the input tensor `t`.

### Factorizations for custom index bipartions

Finally, note that each of the factorizations take a single argument, the tensor map `t`,
and a number of keyword arguments. They perform the factorization according to the given
codomain and domain of the tensor map. In many cases, we want to perform the factorization
according to a different bipartition of the indices. When `BraidingStyle(sectortype(t)) isa
SymmetricBraiding`, we can immediately specify an alternative bipartition of the indices of
`t` in all of these methods, in the form

```julia
factorize(t::AbstracTensorMap, pleft::NTuple{N₁′,Int}, pright::NTuple{N₂′,Int}; kwargs...)
```

where `pleft` will be the indices in the codomain of the new tensor map, and `pright` the
indices of the domain. Here, `factorize` is any of the methods `LinearAlgebra.eigen`, `eig`,
`eigh`, `tsvd`, `LinearAlgebra.svd`, `leftorth`, `rightorth`, `leftnull` and `rightnull`.
This signature does not allow for the exclamation mark, because it amounts to

```julia
factorize!(permute(t, pleft, pright; copy = true); kwargs...)
```

where [`permute`](@ref) was introduced and discussed in the previous section. When the
braiding is not symmetric, the user should manually apply [`braid`](@ref) to bring the
tensor map in proper form before performing the factorization.

Some examples to conclude this section
```@repl tensors
V1 = SU₂Space(0=>2,1/2=>1)
V2 = SU₂Space(0=>1,1/2=>1,1=>1)

t = randn(V1 ⊗ V1, V2);
U, S, W = tsvd(t);
t ≈ U * S * W
D, V = eigh(t'*t);
D ≈ S*S
U'*U ≈ id(domain(U))
S

Q, R = leftorth(t; alg = Polar());
isposdef(R)
Q ≈ U*W
R ≈ W'*S*W

U2, S2, W2, ε = tsvd(t; trunc = truncspace(V1));
W2*W2' ≈ id(codomain(W2))
S2
ε ≈ norm(block(S, Irrep[SU₂](1)))*sqrt(dim(Irrep[SU₂](1)))

L, Q = rightorth(t, (1,), (2,3));
codomain(L), domain(L), domain(Q)
Q*Q'
P = Q'*Q;
P ≈ P*P
t′ = permute(t, (1,), (2,3));
t′ ≈ t′ * P
```

## [Bosonic tensor contractions and tensor networks](@id ss_tensor_contraction)

One of the most important operation with tensor maps is to compose them, more generally
known as contracting them. As mentioned in the section on [category theory](@ref
s_categories), a typical composition of maps in a ribbon category can graphically be
represented as a planar arrangement of the morphisms (i.e. tensor maps, boxes with lines
eminating from top and bottom, corresponding to source and target, i.e. domain and
codomain), where the lines connecting the source and targets of the different morphisms
should be thought of as ribbons, that can braid over or underneath each other, and that can
twist. Technically, we can embed this diagram in ``ℝ × [0,1]`` and attach all the
unconnected line endings corresponding objects in the source at some position ``(x,0)`` for
``x∈ℝ``, and all line endings corresponding to objects in the target at some position
``(x,1)``. The resulting morphism is then invariant under what is known as *framed
three-dimensional isotopy*, i.e. three-dimensional rearrangements of the morphism that
respect the rules of boxes connected by ribbons whose open endings are kept fixed. Such a
two-dimensional diagram cannot easily be encoded in a single line of code.

However, things simplify when the braiding is symmetric (such that over- and under-
crossings become equivalent, i.e. just crossings), and when twists, i.e. self-crossings in
this case, are trivial. This amounts to `BraidingStyle(I) == Bosonic()` in the language of
TensorKit.jl, and is true for any subcategory of ``\mathbf{Vect}``, i.e. ordinary tensors,
possibly with some symmetry constraint. The case of ``\mathbf{SVect}`` and its
subcategories, and more general categories, are discussed below.

In the case of trivial twists, we can deform the diagram such that we first combine every
morphism with a number of coevaluations ``η`` so as to represent it as a tensor, i.e. with a
trivial domain. We can then rearrange the morphism to be all ligned up horizontally, where
the original morphism compositions are now being performed by evaluations ``ϵ``. This
process will generate a number of crossings and twists, where the latter can be omitted
because they act trivially. Similarly, double crossings can also be omitted. As a
consequence, the diagram, or the morphism it represents, is completely specified by the
tensors it is composed of, and which indices between the different tensors are connect, via
the evaluation ``ϵ``, and which indices make up the source and target of the resulting
morphism. If we also compose the resulting morphisms with coevaluations so that it has a
trivial domain, we just have one type of unconnected lines, henceforth called open indices.
We sketch such a rearrangement in the following picture

```@raw html
<img src="../img/tensor-bosoniccontraction.svg" alt="tensor unitary" class="color-invertible"/>
```

Hence, we can now specify such a tensor diagram, henceforth called a tensor contraction or
also tensor network, using a one-dimensional syntax that mimicks
[abstract index notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_index_notation)
and specifies which indices are connected by the evaluation map using Einstein's summation
conventation. Indeed, for `BraidingStyle(I) == Bosonic()`, such a tensor contraction can
take the same format as if all tensors were just multi-dimensional arrays. For this, we
rely on the interface provided by the package
[TensorOperations.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/TensorOperations.jl).

The above picture would be encoded as
```julia
@tensor E[a,b,c,d,e] := A[v,w,d,x]*B[y,z,c,x]*C[v,e,y,b]*D[a,w,z]
```
or
```julia
@tensor E[:] := A[1,2,-4,3]*B[4,5,-3,3]*C[1,-5,4,-2]*D[-1,2,5]
```
where the latter syntax is known as NCON-style, and labels the unconnected or outgoing
indices with negative integers, and the contracted indices with positive integers.

A number of remarks are in order. TensorOperations.jl accepts both integers and any valid
variable name as dummy label for indices, and everything in between `[ ]` is not resolved in
the current context but interpreted as a dummy label. Here, we label the indices of a
`TensorMap`, like `A::TensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}`, in a linear fashion, where the first position
corresponds to the first space in `codomain(A)`, and so forth, up to position `N₁`. Index
`N₁+1`then corresponds to the first space in `domain(A)`. However, because we have applied
the coevaluation ``η``, it actually corresponds to the corresponding dual space, in
accordance with the interface of [`space(A, i)`](@ref) that we introduced
[above](@ref ss_tensor_properties), and as indiated by the dotted box around ``A`` in the
above picture. The same holds for the other tensor maps. Note that our convention also
requires that we braid indices that we brought from the domain to the codomain, and so this
is only unambiguous for a symmetric braiding, where there is a unique way to permute the
indices.

With the current syntax, we create a new object `E` because we use the definition operator
`:=`. Furthermore, with the current syntax, it will be a `Tensor`, i.e. it will have a
trivial domain, and correspond to the dotted box in the picture above, rather than the
actual morphism `E`. We can also directly define `E` with the correct codomain and domain by rather using
```julia
@tensor E[a b c;d e] := A[v,w,d,x]*B[y,z,c,x]*C[v,e,y,b]*D[a,w,z]
```
or
```julia
@tensor E[(a,b,c);(d,e)] := A[v,w,d,x]*B[y,z,c,x]*C[v,e,y,b]*D[a,w,z]
```
where the latter syntax can also be used when the codomain is empty. When using the
assignment operator `=`, the `TensorMap` `E` is assumed to exist and the contents will be
written to the currently allocated memory. Note that for existing tensors, both on the left
hand side and right hand side, trying to specify the indices in the domain and the codomain
seperately using the above syntax, has no effect, as the bipartition of indices are already
fixed by the existing object. Hence, if `E` has been created by the previous line of code,
all of the following lines are now equivalent
```julia
@tensor E[(a,b,c);(d,e)] = A[v,w,d,x]*B[y,z,c,x]*C[v,e,y,b]*D[a,w,z]
@tensor E[a,b,c,d,e] = A[v w d;x]*B[(y,z,c);(x,)]*C[v e y; b]*D[a,w,z]
@tensor E[a b; c d e] = A[v; w d x]*B[y,z,c,x]*C[v,e,y,b]*D[a w;z]
```
and none of those will or can change the partition of the indices of `E` into its codomain
and its domain.

Two final remarks are in order. Firstly, the order of the tensors appearing on the right
hand side is irrelevant, as we can reorder them by using the allowed moves of the Penrose
graphical calculus, which yields some crossings and a twist. As the latter is trivial, it
can be omitted, and we just use the same rules to evaluate the newly ordered tensor
network. For the particular case of matrix matrix multiplication, which also captures more general settings by appropriotely combining spaces into a single line, we indeed find

```@raw html
<img src="../img/tensor-contractionreorder.svg" alt="tensor contraction reorder" class="color-invertible"/>
```

or thus, the following to lines of code yield the same result
```julia
@tensor C[i,j] := B[i,k]*A[k,j]
@tensor C[i,j] := A[k,j]*B[i,k]
```
Reordering of tensors can be used internally by the `@tensor` macro to evaluate the
contraction in a more efficient manner. In particular, the NCON-style of specifying the
contraction gives the user control over the order, and there are other macros, such as
`@tensoropt`, that try to automate this process. There is also an `@ncon` macro and `ncon`
function, an we recommend reading the
[manual of TensorOperations.jl](https://jutho.github.io/TensorOperations.jl/stable/) to
learn more about the possibilities and how they work.

A final remark involves the use of adjoints of tensors. The current framework is such that
the user should not be to worried about the actual bipartition into codomain and domain of
a given `TensorMap` instance. Indeed, for factorizations one just specifies the requested
bipartition via the `factorize(t, pleft, pright)` interface, and for tensor contractions
the `@contract` macro figures out the correct manipulations automatically. However, when
wanting to use the `adjoint` of an instance `t::TensorMap{S,N₁,N₂}`, the resulting
`adjoint(t)` is a `AbstractTensorMap{S,N₂,N₁}` and one need to know the values of `N₁` and
`N₂` to know exactly where the `i`th index of `t` will end up in `adjoint(t)`, and hence to
know and understand the index order of `t'`. Within the `@tensor` macro, one can instead use
`conj()` on the whole index expression so as to be able to use the original index ordering
of `t`. Indeed, for matrices of thus, `TensorMap{S,1,1}` instances, this yields exactly the
equivalence one expects, namely equivalence between the following to expressions.
```julia
@tensor C[i,j] := B'[i,k]*A[k,j]
@tensor C[i,j] := conj(B[k,i])*A[k,j]
```
For e.g. an instance `A::TensorMap{S,3,2}`, the following two syntaxes have the same effect
within an `@tensor` expression: `conj(A[a,b,c,d,e])` and `A'[d,e,a,b,c]`.
